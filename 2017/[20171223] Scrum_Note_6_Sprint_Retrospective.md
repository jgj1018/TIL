The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.
This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants
understand its purpose.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to

- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
-  Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

It can say other way like this

- What went well during the sprint cycle?
- What went wrong during the sprint cycle?
- What could we do differently to improve?

 During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase
product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of “Done”, if appropriate and not in conflict with product or organizational standards

By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements
that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.

- Process improvements are made at the end of every sprint. This ensures that the project team is always improving the way it works.
- The retrospective is a collaborative process among all members, including the team, the product owner, and the ScrumMaster.
- All team members identify what went well and what could be improved.
- The team members discuss the process that they are following and give any suggestions for improvement.
- The team members discuss any other ideas that could improve their productivity.
- The ScrumMaster prioritizes actions and lessons learned based on team direction.
- The retrospective supports team formation and bonding, particularly as any areas of conflict can be identified and dealt with.
- The retrospective helps build the team's sense of ownership and its self-management.

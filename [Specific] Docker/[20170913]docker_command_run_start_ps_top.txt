different between run and start

run  : runs an image
start: starts a container

The docker run command first creates a writeable container layer over the specified image,
and then starts it using the specified command.

That is, docker run is equivalent to the API /containers/create then /containers/(id)/start

and it means, I can create N clone of the same image by using run command.

===================================================================================================

docker run --name mongo -d mongo
docker ps
docker top mongo

docker ps : List containers
-> show all containers(default shows just running)

we can check the process run by docker by using "ps aux show all running processes" on Linux prompt
Container is just nothing more than a process.

docker top {name}

Docker Networks Defaults

Each container connected to a private virtual network "bridge"
Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without -p
Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each app
-network "my_web_app" for mysql and php/apache containers
-network "my_api" for mongo and nodejs container.

====================================================================

bridge network represents the docker0. the docker daemon connects containers to this network by default.
I can see this bridge as part of a host's network stack by using the ifconfig command on the host.

The host network adds a container on the host's network stack, As for as the network is concerned. there is no isolation
between the host machine and the container. 

I can configure the default bridge network, as well as my own user-defined bridge networks.

Containers connected to the default bridge network can communicate with each other by IP address.
Docker does not support automatic service discovery on the default bridge network. If I want containers to be able to resolve
IP addresses by container name, I should use use-defined networks instead.

docker command format

docker <command> <sub_command> {option}

========================================================================

image vs container

An Image is the application we want to run
A Container is an instance of that image running as a process
I can have many containers running off the same image

docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

(1) Downloaded image 'nginx' from Docker Hub
(2) Started a new container from that image
(3) Opened port 80 on the host IP
(4) Routes that traffic to the container IP, port 80

--detached 
-> run backgraound

docker container ls
-> only show running container

docker container ls -a
-> show all the containers

--name {name}
-> give name to a container

docker container logs {name}
-> show logs (when you run a container background)

docker container top

docker container rm {container id}
-> remove container

#nofollow

The nofollow directive is an often used value in a meta tag that can be added to the HTML source code of a webpage to suggest to search engines (most notably Google) not to pass link equity through any links on a given webpage.

```
<a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow">Anchor Text</a>
```
- when?

(1) Links in blog comments – If you took the time writing a valuable blog post for your website, you do not want a competitor or link spammer to be able to add an unhelpful comment to your blog post with a link to his/her own website

(2) Paid links – Another SEO tactic that gained popularity in the blackhat SEO community is the mass purchasing of links across the web. 

# noindex

The noindex directive is an often used value in a meta tag that can be added to the HTML source code of a webpage to suggest to search engines (most notably Google) to not include that particular page in its list of search results.

```
<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
```

- when?

(1) Thank you pages – If you’re including lead capture forms on your website, such as “Contact Us” or “Schedule an Appointment” you likely direct users from your web forms to unique thank you pages once a user submits a form. 

(2) Members only pages – If you have a section of your website dedicated to your employees or organization members, but you do not want those web pages accessible to the general public, or search engines, the “noindex” directive will help keep those pages from being found in SERPs.

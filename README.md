## TIL

Only to improve myself.
TIL can be broke into two parts.

- (1) One is normal `daily TIL`.
- (2) The other one is `bookmark`.
  
Speaking of `daily TIL`, The basic format of it is below

## (1) Today I do

- github commit link in other repository.
- some other description about what I've done.
 
## (2) Today I read

- links that I read completely. I don't add any link I half-read or something I totally couldn't understand. 
- pages of books I'm reading. I can add more memo to recap.


And `bookmark` is just a list of links which I want to read again and again.

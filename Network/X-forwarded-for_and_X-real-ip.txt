X-forwarded-for X-real-ip (When it comes to Nginx)

both of them are a kind of HTTP header.

X-forwarded-for is used for when you want to specify where the request is from when load balancer or proxy is working.

X-real-ip is also a kind of header, it is basically working the same as X-forwarded-for.
but x-forwarded-for can be more than two, but X-real-ip can't (on Nginx)

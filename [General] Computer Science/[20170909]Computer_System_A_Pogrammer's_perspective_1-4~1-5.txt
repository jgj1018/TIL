if the first word of the command line does not correspont to a built-in shell command, then the shell assumes that it is the name
of an executable file that it should load and run.

(1) Buses
Running throughout the system is a collection of electrical conduits called buses that carry bytes of information back and forth
between the components. Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-sized chunks of bytes known as words(64 or 32) which is a
fundamental system parameter that varies across systems.

(2) I/O Devices
Input/Output devices are the system's connection to the external world.

(3) Main memory 
it is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program.

(4) Processor
The central processing unit(CPU), is the engine that interprets (or executes) instructions stored in main memory.
The processor reads the instruction from memory pointed at by the program counter(PC), interprets the bits in the instruction,
performs some simple oeration dictated by the instruction, and then updates the PC to point to the next instruction, which may or
may not be contiguous in memory to the instruction that was just executed.

The processor can read data from the register file almost 100 times faster than from memory. this processor-memory gap
continues to increase. It is easier and cheaper to make processors run faster than it is to make main memory run faster.
To deal with the gap, system designers include smaller and faster storage devices called cache memories that serve as
temporary staging areas for information that the processor is likely to need in the near future.

By setting up caches to hold data that is likely to be accessed often, we can perform most memory operations using the fast caches.

.bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.

(1).bash_profile

when I login via console, (locally or remotely) .bash_profile is executed before the initial command prompt

(2) .bashrc

if I already logged into a machine and open a new terminal window inside it. .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt.
.bashrc is also run when I start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.

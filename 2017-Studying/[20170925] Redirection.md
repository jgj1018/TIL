# Redirection

(1) 301 - Moved Permanently : recommended for SEO
(2) 302 - Found or Moved Temporarily



- definition of Redirect
: A redirect is a way to send both users and search engines to a different URL from the one they originally requested. 

(1) 301

it referes to the HTTP statue code for this type of redirect. it means that visitors and bots that land on that page will be passed to the new URL.

Be aware that when moving a page from one URL to another, the search engines will take some time to discover the 301, recignize it, and credit the new page with the rankings and trust of its predecessor. 

- Other options for redirection, like 302s and meta refreshes, are poor substitutes, as they generally will not pass the rankings and search engine value like a 301 redirect will. The only time these redirects are goo alternatives is if a webmaster purposefully doesn't want to pass link juice from the old page to the new.

(3) 302 (Found HTTP 1.1/ Moved Temporarily HTTP 1.0)

A 302 redirect is similar to a 301 in that visitors and bots are passed to the new page. but link equity may not be passed along. Using 302s will cause search engine crawlers to treat the redirect as temporary, meaning that it may not pass along the link equity that the magical 301 does.

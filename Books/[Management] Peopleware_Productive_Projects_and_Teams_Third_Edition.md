## Part I: Managing the Human Resource

### 1. Somewhere Today, a Project Is Failing

- The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.


- The main reason we tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work is not because it’s more crucial, but because it’s easier to do.


### 2. Make a Cheeseburger, Sell a Cheeseburger


- For most thinking workers, making an occasional mistake is a natural and healthy part of their work. But there can be an almost Biblical association between error on the job and sin. This is an attitude we need to take specific pains to change.


- Speaking to a group of software managers, we introduced a strategy for what we think of as iterative design. The idea is that some designs are intrinsically defect-prone; they ought to be rejected, not repaired. Such dead ends should be expected in the design activity. The lost effort of the dead end is a small price to pay for a clean, fresh start. To our surprise, many managers felt this would pose an impossible political problem for their own bosses: “How can we throw away a product that our company has paid to produce?” They seemed to believe that they’d be better off salvaging the defective version even though it might cost more in the long run.


- The opposite approach would be to encourage people to make some errors. You do this by asking your folks on occasion what dead-end roads they’ve been down, and by making sure they understand that “none” is not the best answer. When people blow it, they should be congratulated—that’s part of what they’re being paid for.


- The uniqueness of every worker is a continued annoyance to the manager who has blindly adopted a management style from the production world. The natural people manager, on the other hand, realizes that uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective. It’s something to be cultivated.


- Unless you’re riding herd on a canceled or about-to-be-canceled project, the entire focus of project management ought to be the dynamics of the development effort. Yet the way we assess people’s value to a new project is often based on their steady-state characteristics: how much code they can write or how much documentation they can produce. We pay far too little attention to how well each of them fits into the effort as a whole.


### 3. Vienna Waits for You


- Productivity ought to mean achieving more in an hour of work, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay. There is a large difference. The Spanish Theory managers dream of attaining new productivity levels through the simple mechanism of unpaid overtime. 


-  Trying to get people to sprint too much can only result in loss of respect for the manager. 


- the process of improving productivity risks motivating employees to look for more satisfying work elsewhere.


- People under time pressure don’t work better—they just work faster.


### 4. Quality—If Time Permits


- A novice manager may believe that work can be completed without people’s emotions ever getting involved, but if you have any experience at all as a manager, you have learned the opposite. Our work gives us plenty of opportunity to exercise the emotions.


- The hard-nosed, real-world manager part of you has an answer to all this: “Some of my folks would tinker forever with a task, all in the name of ‘Quality.’ But the market doesn’t give a damn about that much quality—it’s screaming for the product to be delivered yesterday and will accept it even in a quick-and-dirty state.” In many cases, you may be right about the market, but the decision to pressure people into delivering a product that doesn’t measure up to their own quality standards is almost always a mistake.


- In the long run, market-based quality costs more. 


- Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity.


- Crosby gave numerous examples and a sound rationale for the idea that letting the builder set a satisfying quality standard of his own will result in a productivity gain sufficient to offset the cost of improved quality.


- Quality is free, but only to those who are willing to pay heavily for it.


### 5. Parkinson’s Law Revisited


- Programmers seem to be a bit more productive after they’ve done the estimate themselves.


- When the schedule for a project is totally unreasonable and unrealistic, and no amount of overtime can allow it to be made, the project team becomes angry and frustrated . . . and morale drops to the bottom


- when they investigated the productivity of 24 projects for which no estimates were prepared at all. These projects far outperformed all the others


- The decision to apply schedule pressure to a project needs to be made in much the same way you decide whether or not to punish your child: If punishment is rare and your timing is impeccable so the justification is easily apparent, then maybe it can help. If you do it all the time, it’s just a sign that you’ve got problems of your own.


### 6. Laetrile

- None of the measures you’ve taken or are likely to take can actually make productivity soar. What they do, though, is to keep everybody healthy: People like to keep their minds engaged, to learn, and to improve


- technology is moving swiftly, but (the High-Tech Illusion again) most of what you’re doing is not truly high-tech work. While the machines have changed enormously, the business of software development has been rather static.


- The manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.


## Part II: The Office Environment

- There are a million ways to lose a workday, but not even a single way to get one back.


### 8. “You Never Get Anything Done around Here between 9 and 5.”

- A disturbing possibility is that overtime is not so much a means to increase the quantity of work time as to improve its average quality


- All the more discouraging is that the manager wasn’t even particularly embarrassed about failing to take steps to improve the environment


- People who had ten years of experience did not outperform those with two years of experience. 


- There was a very weak relationship between salary and performance


- While this 10 to 1 productivity differential among programmers is understandable, there is also a 10 to 1 difference in productivity among software organizations.


-  Over the whole sample, the best organization (the one with the best average performance of its representatives) worked more than ten times faster than the worst organization. 


- The top quartile, those who did the exercise most rapidly and effectively, work in space that is substantially different from that of the bottom quartile.


- The data presented above does not exactly prove that a better workplace will help people to perform better. It may only indicate that people who perform better tend to gravitate toward organizations that provide a better workplace.


### 9. Saving Money on Space


- the savings of a cost-reduced workplace are attractive, but compared to what? The obvious answer is that the savings have to be compared to the risk of lost effectiveness.


### 10. Brain Time versus Body Time

- If you’re a manager, you may be relatively unsympathetic to the frustrations of being in no-flow. After all, you do most of your own work in interrupt mode—that’s management—but the people who work for you need to get into flow. Anything that keeps them from it will reduce their effectiveness and the satisfaction they take in their work. It will also increase the cost of getting the work done.


- What matters is not the amount of time you’re present, but the amount of time that you’re working at full potential.


- If you buy the idea that a good environment ought to afford workers the possibility of working in flow, the collection of uninterrupted-hour data can give you some meaningful metric evidence of just how good or bad your environment is.


## Part III: The Right People

### 14. The Hornblower Factor


- People usually don’t stay put long enough, and the manager just doesn’t have enough leverage to make a difference in their nature. So the people who work for you through whatever period will be more or less the same at the end as they were at the beginning. If they’re not right for the job from the start, they never will be. All of this means that getting the right people in the first place is all-important. 


- The need for uniformity is a sign of insecurity on the part of management. Strong managers don’t care when team members cut their hair or whether they wear ties. Their pride is tied only to their staff’s accomplishments.


- Entropy is levelness or sameness. The more it increases, the less potential there is to generate energy or do work.


- Entropy is always increasing in the organization. That’s why most elderly institutions are tighter and a lot less fun than sprightly young companies.


- The most successful manager is the one who shakes up the local entropy to bring in the right people and let them be themselves, even though they may deviate from the corporate norm.


### 15. Let’s Talk about Leadership


- But the best leadership—the kind that people can mention only with evident emotion and deep respect—is most often exercised by people without positional power. It happens outside the official hierarchy of delegated authority.


- leadership is not about extracting anything from us; it’s about service. The leadership that the Mikes of the world provide enables their endeavors to go forth. While they sometimes set explicit directions, their main role is that of a catalyst, not a director. 


- The propensity to lead without being given the authority to do so is what, in organizations, distinguishes people that can innovate and break free of the constraints that limit their competitors.


### 16. Hiring a Juggler


- You’re hiring a person to produce a product, presumably similar to those he or she has made before. You need to examine a sample of those products to see the quality of work the candidate does.


### 18. Childhood’s End


- Articulating the contract to young workers is going to be essential to give them a chance to fit in. If work needs to be done in flow, then your people need to be ready to focus. Continuous-partial-attention periods have to be defined as personal time off, acceptable within limits during the workday. The rest of the workday is for, well, work.


### 19. Happy to Be Here


- In an organization with high turnover, nobody is willing to take the long view. If the organization is a bank


- If people only stick around a year or two, the only way to conserve the best people is to promote them quickly. 


- Many of us have come to believe that companies that promote early are where the action is. That’s natural, because as young workers we’re eager to get ahead. But from the corporate perspective, late promotion is a sign of health. In companies with low turnover, promotion into the first-level management position comes only after as much as ten years with the company.


- The insidious effect here is that turnover engenders turnover. People leave quickly, so there’s no use spending money on training. Since the company has invested nothing in the individual, the individual thinks nothing of moving on. New people are not hired for their extraordinary qualities, since replacing extraordinary qualities is too difficult. The feeling that the company sees nothing extraordinary in the worker makes the worker feel unappreciated as an individual. Other people are leaving all the time, so there’s something wrong with you if you’re still here next year.


- A common feature of companies with the lowest turnover is widespread retraining. You’re forever bumping into managers and officers who started out as secretaries, payroll clerks, or in the mailroom. They came into the company green, often right out of school. When they needed new skills to make a change, the company provided those skills. No job is a dead end.


- Again, one can prove that retraining is not the cheapest way to fill a new slot. It’s always cheaper in the short run to fire the person who needs retraining and hire someone else who already has the required skills. Most organizations do just that. The best organizations do not. They realize that retraining helps to build the mentality of permanence that results in low turnover and a strong sense of community. They realize that it more than justifies its cost.


### 20. Human Capital


- An expense is money that gets used up. At the end of the month, the money is gone and so is the heat (or whatever the expense was for). An investment, on the other hand, is use of an asset to purchase another asset. The value has not been used up, but only converted from one form to another. When you treat an expenditure as an investment instead of as an expense, you are capitalizing the expenditure.


- But now suppose you send that same worker off to a training seminar for a week. His salary and the seminar fee have been spent on something that is not “gone” at the end of the month. Whatever he has learned persists in his head through the coming months. If you’ve spent your training money wisely, it is an investment, perhaps a very good one. But, by accounting convention, we expense it anyway.


- Companies go through periods in which middle and upper managers vie to outdo each other in thinking up ways to improve near-term performance (quarterly earnings) by sacrificing the longer term. This is usually called “bottom-line consciousness,” but we prefer to give it another name: “eating the seed corn.”


- Companies that downsize are frankly admitting that their upper management has blown it.


- Companies that manage their investment sensibly will prosper in the long run. Companies of knowledge workers have to realize that it is their investment in human capital that matters most. The good ones already do.


## Part IV: Growing Productive Teams


- Think back over a particularly enjoyable work experience from your career. What was it that made the experience such a pleasure? The simplistic answer is, “Challenge.” Good work experiences have always got a fair measure of challenge about them.


- The challenge of the work is important, but not in and of itself; it is important because it gives us something to focus on together.


### 21. The Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of the Parts

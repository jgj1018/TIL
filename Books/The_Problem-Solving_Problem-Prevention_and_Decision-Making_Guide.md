- A problem solver must always be impartial and objective, and not have preconceived notions, ideas, or biases on what is causing the problem. Each problem has its own set of conditions or circumstances and most of the time the answer lies in the data and information surrounding these conditions.

- A good problem solver must be analytical and systematic in his or her approach to problems. One of the keys to solving problems is the art of asking the right questions in a methodical fashion. 

- Solving problems requires imagination, creativity, and ingenuity. Solving problems sometimes requires abstract thinking, and necessitates imaginative and inventive actions.

- Solving problems requires dedication, perseverance, and commitment, because the answers are sometimes obscure or concealed and, therefore, not always obvious. 

- A good problem solver has curiosity. When people are curious, they are interested in understanding why things happen and will probe below the surface of the problem looking for things that may not be obvious or evident above the surface. 

- It takes courage, daring, and guts to be a good problem solver. Because there is usually always a negative aura or atmosphere surrounding problems, people who are closest to and responsible for the area with the problem sometimes feel threatened. Because they are feeling vulnerable and exposed, they generally don’t like to be questioned, but they must have the courage and fortitude to push forward and seek answers. 

- Solving problems is a journey and an exploration into what happened, so having a sense of adventure is fundamental to reaching your destination.

- A good problem solver must demonstrate enthusiasm during the problem-solving journey. There will be times when the situation may appear hopeless to the team, but your positive outlook and enthusiasm will guide you and your team through the process.

- Finding root causes and developing solutions to problems are not always clear-cut, straightforward, or uncomplicated, so a good problem solver must demonstrate patience, persistence, and staying power. 

- a good problem solver should be vigilant and always expect the unexpected. Just when you think you may have exposed the root cause of a problem, or have discovered the causal pathway of the problem, new information or something unanticipated may come out of the blue and catch you off guard if you aren’t alert to this possibility. So be cautious and attentive that new information could come at any time that will change your point of view.

- for many of us, to make blind adjustments to otherwise stable processes or systems without understanding the simple cause-and-effect relationships that are driving the negative performance. The bottom line is that, characteristically, many of us tend to panic and do stupid things, foolish things, irresponsible things that we might not do if we thought through the problem more or didn’t have all this pressure! Whatever the reason or motivation, it is clear that, making pointless or unwarranted changes without understanding why is the worst reaction possible, because it simply complicates and confuses the situation. That’s the problem with problems: They have a tendency to change our behaviors and make us do things that we instinctively know are wrong. It’s almost as if there is some supernatural or paranormal power at work here. To complicate matters, there are different types of problems and each requires a different tactic if we are to resolve them effectively.

- Problems are divided into three fundamental categories as follows: Problems that have resulted from a change or adjustment from existing conditions, or change-related problems. Problems that are persistent and have seemingly been around forever and are therefore chronic problems. Problems that are both chronic and change related, or what I call hybrid problems.

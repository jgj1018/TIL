##### 1.1 THE DNA OF A GOOD PROBLEM SOLVER

- A problem solver must always be impartial and objective, and not have preconceived notions, ideas, or biases on what is causing the problem. Each problem has its own set of conditions or circumstances and most of the time the answer lies in the data and information surrounding these conditions.

- A good problem solver must be analytical and systematic in his or her approach to problems. One of the keys to solving problems is the art of asking the right questions in a methodical fashion. 

- Solving problems requires imagination, creativity, and ingenuity. Solving problems sometimes requires abstract thinking, and necessitates imaginative and inventive actions.

- Solving problems requires dedication, perseverance, and commitment, because the answers are sometimes obscure or concealed and, therefore, not always obvious. 

- A good problem solver has curiosity. When people are curious, they are interested in understanding why things happen and will probe below the surface of the problem looking for things that may not be obvious or evident above the surface. 

- It takes courage, daring, and guts to be a good problem solver. Because there is usually always a negative aura or atmosphere surrounding problems, people who are closest to and responsible for the area with the problem sometimes feel threatened. Because they are feeling vulnerable and exposed, they generally don’t like to be questioned, but they must have the courage and fortitude to push forward and seek answers. 

- Solving problems is a journey and an exploration into what happened, so having a sense of adventure is fundamental to reaching your destination.

- A good problem solver must demonstrate enthusiasm during the problem-solving journey. There will be times when the situation may appear hopeless to the team, but your positive outlook and enthusiasm will guide you and your team through the process.

- Finding root causes and developing solutions to problems are not always clear-cut, straightforward, or uncomplicated, so a good problem solver must demonstrate patience, persistence, and staying power. 

- a good problem solver should be vigilant and always expect the unexpected. Just when you think you may have exposed the root cause of a problem, or have discovered the causal pathway of the problem, new information or something unanticipated may come out of the blue and catch you off guard if you aren’t alert to this possibility. So be cautious and attentive that new information could come at any time that will change your point of view.

- for many of us, to make blind adjustments to otherwise stable processes or systems without understanding the simple cause-and-effect relationships that are driving the negative performance. The bottom line is that, characteristically, many of us tend to panic and do stupid things, foolish things, irresponsible things that we might not do if we thought through the problem more or didn’t have all this pressure! Whatever the reason or motivation, it is clear that, making pointless or unwarranted changes without understanding why is the worst reaction possible, because it simply complicates and confuses the situation. That’s the problem with problems: They have a tendency to change our behaviors and make us do things that we instinctively know are wrong. It’s almost as if there is some supernatural or paranormal power at work here. To complicate matters, there are different types of problems and each requires a different tactic if we are to resolve them effectively.

##### Problems are divided into three fundamental categories as follows 

- Problems that have resulted from a change or adjustment from existing conditions, or change-related problems.
- Problems that are persistent and have seemingly been around forever and are therefore chronic problems.
- Problems that are both chronic and change related, or what I call hybrid problems.

- Kepner and Tregoe, in their problem-solving classic The New Rational Manager, characterize problems simply as deviations from expected performance

##### when is the deviation that we observe considered to be a problem?

- The deviation or performance shift must be recognized and perceived as being negative to the organization.
- The cause of the performance deviation isn’t known. That is, the root cause is not immediately established using “normal” problem-solving techniques, which results in an extended period of time at the new negative performance level. Obviously, if the cause isn’t known, then the solution won’t be known either, so the performance problem lingers.
- Both the root cause and the solution are known, but the solution can’t be implemented because it either costs too much or takes too long. As pressure mounts to have the problem fixed, more often than not the symptoms get treated and a quick fix is implemented. This, in turn, usually prolongs the problem episode, or sets the stage for it to return or actually deteriorate even further.

---

- do not ignore or disregard positive deviations! Why? Because in my opinion, unexplained positive changes in performance have potentially the same consequences as negative changes. That is, if we don’t understand what prompted the positive change in performance, then we certainly won’t be able to understand or explain why the performance suddenly changed back to its original, “normal” level of performance, and it will happen at some point in the future.

- The major difference between change-related problems and chronic problems is where we focus our efforts. In change-related problems, we focus most of our efforts on determining what changed to create the new level of performance and when the change occurred. But, when we have a situation where the performance of one item has never been what it “should” be compared to one that performs to expectations, we can assume that one of the conditions necessary to attain the expected level of performance does not exist and never has. In this case, we must focus most of our efforts in the area of distinctions, or differences between where or when we have the performance problem compared to where or when we don’t. That is, there is something distinct or different when comparing the supposedly identical units, processes, or materials. If we are to successfully solve chronic type problems, then we must find the critical differences or distinctions between the two objects, and take actions that are specifically aimed at eliminating or reducing the differences.

- Both are serious problems: One is short term and requires immediate attention, while the other is chronic and requires thoughtful and considerate action! One thing to remember when you are faced with a hybrid problem is to separate the problem into its constituent parts. Disconnect the change-related problem from the chronic problem, because the solution to each will be different.

##### 1.7THE 4 C’S OF PROBLEM SOLVING

- Contain the problem—No matter whether the problem is located within your plant or facility, or has already reached your customer, the first action is to always contain or confine the problem. That is, you must stop the bleeding immediately and limit its scope.

- Find the cause of the problem—Once you have caged and confined the problem, it is imperative that you find the root cause or origin of the problem. 

- Correct the problem—As soon as the cause of the problem has been determined, you must take swift and pragmatic action to find an effective countermeasure and implement it with expediency.

- Control the problem—Once the problem has been resolved, always implement some kind of control that will prevent the problem from recurring. 

##### Four Basic Tools for Problem Solving

- The four tools are the run chart, the Pareto chart, the cause-and-effect diagram, and the causal chain. The run chart will answer the questions of when the problem started and when it has occurred since it started, and will then help identify whether it is a change- or launch-related problem. The Pareto chart will help the team determine things like where the problem is, which machine is creating the problem, and who has the problem. The cause-and-effect diagram will be facilitated with the creation of a list of potential causes, whereas the causal chain will help with the team formulate the chain of events that led to the problem (i.e., the hypothesis).

- Whereas the run chart answers the questions of if and when a change has occurred, the Pareto chart is more of a comparative tool. That is, if we suspect differences in performance between things like machines, people, or even days of the week, then we can visualize these differences with a Pareto chart.

- Remember, the primary purpose of a causal chain is to develop a stepwise chain of events that explains why a particular performance shortfall exists. Once this is complete, hypotheses or theories can be formulated as to why a problem exists.

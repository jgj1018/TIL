##### 1.1 THE DNA OF A GOOD PROBLEM SOLVER

- A problem solver must always be impartial and objective, and not have preconceived notions, ideas, or biases on what is causing the problem. Each problem has its own set of conditions or circumstances and most of the time the answer lies in the data and information surrounding these conditions.

- A good problem solver must be analytical and systematic in his or her approach to problems. One of the keys to solving problems is the art of asking the right questions in a methodical fashion. 

- Solving problems requires imagination, creativity, and ingenuity. Solving problems sometimes requires abstract thinking, and necessitates imaginative and inventive actions.

- Solving problems requires dedication, perseverance, and commitment, because the answers are sometimes obscure or concealed and, therefore, not always obvious. 

- A good problem solver has curiosity. When people are curious, they are interested in understanding why things happen and will probe below the surface of the problem looking for things that may not be obvious or evident above the surface. 

- It takes courage, daring, and guts to be a good problem solver. Because there is usually always a negative aura or atmosphere surrounding problems, people who are closest to and responsible for the area with the problem sometimes feel threatened. Because they are feeling vulnerable and exposed, they generally don’t like to be questioned, but they must have the courage and fortitude to push forward and seek answers. 

- Solving problems is a journey and an exploration into what happened, so having a sense of adventure is fundamental to reaching your destination.

- A good problem solver must demonstrate enthusiasm during the problem-solving journey. There will be times when the situation may appear hopeless to the team, but your positive outlook and enthusiasm will guide you and your team through the process.

- Finding root causes and developing solutions to problems are not always clear-cut, straightforward, or uncomplicated, so a good problem solver must demonstrate patience, persistence, and staying power. 

- a good problem solver should be vigilant and always expect the unexpected. Just when you think you may have exposed the root cause of a problem, or have discovered the causal pathway of the problem, new information or something unanticipated may come out of the blue and catch you off guard if you aren’t alert to this possibility. So be cautious and attentive that new information could come at any time that will change your point of view.

- for many of us, to make blind adjustments to otherwise stable processes or systems without understanding the simple cause-and-effect relationships that are driving the negative performance. The bottom line is that, characteristically, many of us tend to panic and do stupid things, foolish things, irresponsible things that we might not do if we thought through the problem more or didn’t have all this pressure! Whatever the reason or motivation, it is clear that, making pointless or unwarranted changes without understanding why is the worst reaction possible, because it simply complicates and confuses the situation. That’s the problem with problems: They have a tendency to change our behaviors and make us do things that we instinctively know are wrong. It’s almost as if there is some supernatural or paranormal power at work here. To complicate matters, there are different types of problems and each requires a different tactic if we are to resolve them effectively.

##### Problems are divided into three fundamental categories as follows 

- Problems that have resulted from a change or adjustment from existing conditions, or change-related problems.
- Problems that are persistent and have seemingly been around forever and are therefore chronic problems.
- Problems that are both chronic and change related, or what I call hybrid problems.

---

- Kepner and Tregoe, in their problem-solving classic The New Rational Manager, characterize problems simply as deviations from expected performance

##### when is the deviation that we observe considered to be a problem?

- The deviation or performance shift must be recognized and perceived as being negative to the organization.
- The cause of the performance deviation isn’t known. That is, the root cause is not immediately established using “normal” problem-solving techniques, which results in an extended period of time at the new negative performance level. Obviously, if the cause isn’t known, then the solution won’t be known either, so the performance problem lingers.
- Both the root cause and the solution are known, but the solution can’t be implemented because it either costs too much or takes too long. As pressure mounts to have the problem fixed, more often than not the symptoms get treated and a quick fix is implemented. This, in turn, usually prolongs the problem episode, or sets the stage for it to return or actually deteriorate even further.

---

- do not ignore or disregard positive deviations! Why? Because in my opinion, unexplained positive changes in performance have potentially the same consequences as negative changes. That is, if we don’t understand what prompted the positive change in performance, then we certainly won’t be able to understand or explain why the performance suddenly changed back to its original, “normal” level of performance, and it will happen at some point in the future.

- The major difference between change-related problems and chronic problems is where we focus our efforts. In change-related problems, we focus most of our efforts on determining what changed to create the new level of performance and when the change occurred. But, when we have a situation where the performance of one item has never been what it “should” be compared to one that performs to expectations, we can assume that one of the conditions necessary to attain the expected level of performance does not exist and never has. In this case, we must focus most of our efforts in the area of distinctions, or differences between where or when we have the performance problem compared to where or when we don’t. That is, there is something distinct or different when comparing the supposedly identical units, processes, or materials. If we are to successfully solve chronic type problems, then we must find the critical differences or distinctions between the two objects, and take actions that are specifically aimed at eliminating or reducing the differences.

- Both are serious problems: One is short term and requires immediate attention, while the other is chronic and requires thoughtful and considerate action! One thing to remember when you are faced with a hybrid problem is to separate the problem into its constituent parts. Disconnect the change-related problem from the chronic problem, because the solution to each will be different.

##### 1.7THE 4 C’S OF PROBLEM SOLVING

- Contain the problem—No matter whether the problem is located within your plant or facility, or has already reached your customer, the first action is to always contain or confine the problem. That is, you must stop the bleeding immediately and limit its scope.

- Find the cause of the problem—Once you have caged and confined the problem, it is imperative that you find the root cause or origin of the problem. 

- Correct the problem—As soon as the cause of the problem has been determined, you must take swift and pragmatic action to find an effective countermeasure and implement it with expediency.

- Control the problem—Once the problem has been resolved, always implement some kind of control that will prevent the problem from recurring. 

##### Four Basic Tools for Problem Solving

- The four tools are the run chart, the Pareto chart, the cause-and-effect diagram, and the causal chain. The run chart will answer the questions of when the problem started and when it has occurred since it started, and will then help identify whether it is a change- or launch-related problem. The Pareto chart will help the team determine things like where the problem is, which machine is creating the problem, and who has the problem. The cause-and-effect diagram will be facilitated with the creation of a list of potential causes, whereas the causal chain will help with the team formulate the chain of events that led to the problem (i.e., the hypothesis).

- Whereas the run chart answers the questions of if and when a change has occurred, the Pareto chart is more of a comparative tool. That is, if we suspect differences in performance between things like machines, people, or even days of the week, then we can visualize these differences with a Pareto chart.

- Pareto charts are really quite simple to create. Along the horizontal or x-axis, we simply place what we are comparing (e.g., operators, machines), and then place whatever we are measuring along the vertical or y-axis.

- It’s never easy to eat an elephant or an apple in one single bite, but if we take one bite at a time, we have a much better chance of succeeding. Multilevel Pareto charts help the team focus and prioritize its efforts.

- Remember, the primary purpose of a causal chain is to develop a stepwise chain of events that explains why a particular performance shortfall exists. Once this is complete, hypotheses or theories can be formulated as to why a problem exists. 

##### A Structured Approach to Problem Solving

- systematic approach keeps the team focused and helps discourage a team from wandering aimlessly.
- using a structured approach helps the team understand what information is needed, and then facilitates the organization of data, thoughts, and information.
- by using and following a systematic approach, with its logical progression of tasks and activities, the probability of finding the true root cause increases significantly.
-  by using a structured approach in a team setting, the maximum utilization of resources will be achieved in the shortest period of time.

##### Define, Describe, and Appraise the Problem

- This is an important first step because all of the work that follows will be focused on solving and correcting the problem as we have defined it.
- Peter Drucker’s opening quote sums up what we have to do in this chapter: Ask the right questions. Just what are these right questions? First, they are basic questions that will help the team develop a complete definition of the problem and allow the team to move forward. 

- What is the problem? That is, what specifically isn’t working as we would like it to be, and what specifically is the defect or malfunction?

- Where is the problem? With this question, we are attempting to define where the performance problem is geographically, and where on the object we are observing the problem.

- When does the problem occur? Here we are looking for the timing of the problem from its inception, subsequent appearances of the problem, and specifically when in the operating cycle is the problem observed. (...) The most effective tool to utilize here is the trend or run chart, which has an axis (x-axis) for time and an axis (y-axis) for monitoring the level of the problem.

- How many units or items have the problem? Since we are trying to define the magnitude of the problem, we need to know the extent to which the problem exists. (...) Here you make note that only machine A is impacted. The most effective tool to answer this question is the Pareto chart. The Pareto chart provides a graphical representation of the problem for everyone to see.

- Who has the problem? If there are humans involved (i.e., operators), then we need to define exactly who the operators are with the problem. Here we can use a Pareto chart or a simple matrix of operators.

- Is the problem change-related, or is it a launch-related problem, or is it a hybrid of a change- and launch-related problem? This is important to determine, because our approach to solving the problem is uniquely different. In a change-related problem, we focus most of our efforts and attention on determining exactly what changed and when the change occurred. In a launch-related problem, the answer to the problem lies in accurately determining the differences or distinctions between where or when the problem occurs compared to when or where it doesn’t. 

- In a change-related problem, our primary tool is a trend or run chart, while in a launch-related problem we utilize Pareto charts or matrices as a means of comparison. Of course, in a hybrid type problem, we use both the run chart and the Pareto chart.

- What is the trend of the problem? That is, is the problem increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant? The trend or run chart developed earlier will answer this question.

- Develop a problem statement. The final step in the definition of the problem is to develop a problem statement that incorporates all of the information we have just developed (i.e., the what, the where, the when, the who, the magnitude/frequency, and the trend) into a single statement that fully describes the problem we are trying to solve.

##### Investigate, Organize, and Analyze the Data

- When we attempt to solve a problem, we are, in effect, crime scene investigators. We look at the symptoms of the problem, and then try to logically tie what we find to some reasonable explanation of the causal chain of events.

- My recommendation is that you collect as much information as is available, as close to the onset of the problem as possible. In the end, it may not be needed, but if it isn’t collected and it is needed later, there isn’t much you can do about it. The guidelines for collecting this data are simple. If there is even a remote possibility that it could contribute to the problem, then collect it. Having said this, let me give a word of caution. Don’t ever let the desire to collect data interfere with the problem-solving process. Too often I have seen an inordinate amount of effort placed on data collection and too little placed on solving the problem.

- The machines or people who are performing closer to or at the expected level of performance are called defect-free configurations (DFCs). 

-  DFCs tell us that there is something uniquely different about where or when you see the problem compared to where or when you don’t. If you can pinpoint these differences, then you are on the road to problem resolution.

- we are only looking for differences and not the reason why the difference might be important. This is an extremely important thing to remember, because differences should only be discounted or accepted after discussions later in the process.

- Solving a problem is very much like putting together a jigsaw puzzle with pieces of information that fit together to form a logical cause.

- The cause-and-effect diagram is a good visual representation of cause-and-effect relationships that aid in the development of potential causes that produce the observed effect.

- It is important not to reject any idea that a team member presents, even though it may seem irrelevant, simply because a rejection during a brainstorming session can have a negative effect on the team’s creative juices and harmony.

- Eliminating possible causes from the cause-and-effect diagram, must only come through analyzing data, uncovering facts, having discussions, and achieving a consensus among team members.

##### Formulate and Test a Causal Theory

- To develop a hypothesis is to develop a theory as to the sequence of events that led to the reason or reasons why a problem appeared. Of the tools available to the team, the causal chain is, for me, the most effective. 

- In creating the causal chain, we are attempting to not only find the cause or causes of the effect we have observed, but also the series, or string of events, that happened to create the problem.

- When creating causal chains, or developing hypotheses, we always start our journey with the symptoms of the problem, but we also have to consider the impact of changes, defect-free configurations (DFCs), and distinctions. Our theory or theories must satisfy or explain what we have listed in each of these categories of information.

##### Choose the Most Probable Cause

- Forcing the pieces to fit the puzzle. Although this trap seems difficult to believe, a team can actually force fit information to a problem profile that fits a problem cause without ever realizing it is happening. This usually happens when one person has a preconceived notion of what caused the problem. In order to guard against this trap, always check your logic to make certain that no puzzle pieces are missing.

- It is important to remember that sometimes problems have more than one cause, but typically a single root cause results in the problem.

##### Develop, Test, and Implement Solutions

- The old expression “there’s more than one way to skin a cat” is really true when it concerns developing solutions to problems.

- Timing is very important, so we don’t want a solution that takes days or weeks to implement. The solution needs to be implemented as soon as possible, so that the performance improves as quickly as possible.

- Developing a solution for a launch-related problem requires more creativity and a more in-depth review of alternatives.

- Hybrid problems, you will recall, are those that combine the elements of both a change- and launch-related problem, so the solutions are logically a combination of both. There is no simple formula for determining a solution, but my suggestion is simple: Take care of reversing the change first and then attack the rest. Just follow the advice I gave you for both the change-related and launch-related problem solutions and good luck.

- After the solution has been tested, there are several other things that must occur. Communication of the solution to everyone who needs to know is absolutely imperative if the solution is going to be lasting.

- As a matter of fact, no solution is really complete without a control to monitor the performance of the process. 

##### Implement, Document, and Celebrate

- No problem-solving event should ever be considered complete until some kind of safeguard is put in place to minimize the probability of a recurrence of the problem.

- It is important to remember that the purpose of a control is to give an advanced warning that something may be wrong before it is actually wrong

- One final and important activity to complete is to document your success. Documenting how your team successfully solved the problem does several things for the organization. First, it reinforces that the use of a structured and systematic approach to problems really does work. Second, your report is there for future problem-solving teams to follow as a roadmap. Third, if the problem you have solved should ever return (God forbid!), then your team’s report is available as a ready reference.

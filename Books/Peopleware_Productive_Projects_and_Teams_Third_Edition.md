### 1. Somewhere Today, a Project Is Failing

- The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.


- The main reason we tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work is not because it’s more crucial, but because it’s easier to do.


### 2. Make a Cheeseburger, Sell a Cheeseburger


- For most thinking workers, making an occasional mistake is a natural and healthy part of their work. But there can be an almost Biblical association between error on the job and sin. This is an attitude we need to take specific pains to change.


- Speaking to a group of software managers, we introduced a strategy for what we think of as iterative design. The idea is that some designs are intrinsically defect-prone; they ought to be rejected, not repaired. Such dead ends should be expected in the design activity. The lost effort of the dead end is a small price to pay for a clean, fresh start. To our surprise, many managers felt this would pose an impossible political problem for their own bosses: “How can we throw away a product that our company has paid to produce?” They seemed to believe that they’d be better off salvaging the defective version even though it might cost more in the long run.


- The opposite approach would be to encourage people to make some errors. You do this by asking your folks on occasion what dead-end roads they’ve been down, and by making sure they understand that “none” is not the best answer. When people blow it, they should be congratulated—that’s part of what they’re being paid for.


- The uniqueness of every worker is a continued annoyance to the manager who has blindly adopted a management style from the production world. The natural people manager, on the other hand, realizes that uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective. It’s something to be cultivated.


- Unless you’re riding herd on a canceled or about-to-be-canceled project, the entire focus of project management ought to be the dynamics of the development effort. Yet the way we assess people’s value to a new project is often based on their steady-state characteristics: how much code they can write or how much documentation they can produce. We pay far too little attention to how well each of them fits into the effort as a whole.


### 3. Vienna Waits for You


- Productivity ought to mean achieving more in an hour of work, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay. There is a large difference. The Spanish Theory managers dream of attaining new productivity levels through the simple mechanism of unpaid overtime. 


-  Trying to get people to sprint too much can only result in loss of respect for the manager. 


- the process of improving productivity risks motivating employees to look for more satisfying work elsewhere.


- People under time pressure don’t work better—they just work faster.


### 4. Quality—If Time Permits


- A novice manager may believe that work can be completed without people’s emotions ever getting involved, but if you have any experience at all as a manager, you have learned the opposite. Our work gives us plenty of opportunity to exercise the emotions.


- The hard-nosed, real-world manager part of you has an answer to all this: “Some of my folks would tinker forever with a task, all in the name of ‘Quality.’ But the market doesn’t give a damn about that much quality—it’s screaming for the product to be delivered yesterday and will accept it even in a quick-and-dirty state.” In many cases, you may be right about the market, but the decision to pressure people into delivering a product that doesn’t measure up to their own quality standards is almost always a mistake.


- In the long run, market-based quality costs more. 


- Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity.


- Crosby gave numerous examples and a sound rationale for the idea that letting the builder set a satisfying quality standard of his own will result in a productivity gain sufficient to offset the cost of improved quality.


- Quality is free, but only to those who are willing to pay heavily for it.


### 5. Parkinson’s Law Revisited


- Programmers seem to be a bit more productive after they’ve done the estimate themselves.


- When the schedule for a project is totally unreasonable and unrealistic, and no amount of overtime can allow it to be made, the project team becomes angry and frustrated . . . and morale drops to the bottom


- when they investigated the productivity of 24 projects for which no estimates were prepared at all. These projects far outperformed all the others


- The decision to apply schedule pressure to a project needs to be made in much the same way you decide whether or not to punish your child: If punishment is rare and your timing is impeccable so the justification is easily apparent, then maybe it can help. If you do it all the time, it’s just a sign that you’ve got problems of your own.


### 6. Laetrile

- None of the measures you’ve taken or are likely to take can actually make productivity soar. What they do, though, is to keep everybody healthy: People like to keep their minds engaged, to learn, and to improve


- technology is moving swiftly, but (the High-Tech Illusion again) most of what you’re doing is not truly high-tech work. While the machines have changed enormously, the business of software development has been rather static.


- The manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.


### Part II: The Office Environment

- There are a million ways to lose a workday, but not even a single way to get one back.


### 8. “You Never Get Anything Done around Here between 9 and 5.”

- A disturbing possibility is that overtime is not so much a means to increase the quantity of work time as to improve its average quality


- All the more discouraging is that the manager wasn’t even particularly embarrassed about failing to take steps to improve the environment


- People who had ten years of experience did not outperform those with two years of experience. 


- There was a very weak relationship between salary and performance


- While this 10 to 1 productivity differential among programmers is understandable, there is also a 10 to 1 difference in productivity among software organizations.


-  Over the whole sample, the best organization (the one with the best average performance of its representatives) worked more than ten times faster than the worst organization. 


- The top quartile, those who did the exercise most rapidly and effectively, work in space that is substantially different from that of the bottom quartile.


- The data presented above does not exactly prove that a better workplace will help people to perform better. It may only indicate that people who perform better tend to gravitate toward organizations that provide a better workplace.


### 9. Saving Money on Space


- the savings of a cost-reduced workplace are attractive, but compared to what? The obvious answer is that the savings have to be compared to the risk of lost effectiveness.

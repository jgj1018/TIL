# 1. Project Management Framework

## Basic Concepts in Project Management

- Project. A project is a work effort made over a finite period of time with a start and a finish to create a unique product, service, or result. Because a project has a start and an end, it is also called a temporary effort or endeavor.

- Project Phase. A project phase is a set of logically related activities that usually completes one or more major deliverables of the project. The phases are generally completed in sequence; however, an overlap is possible in some situations. Depending on its size and complexity, a project may have one or more phases.

- Project Life Cycle. It is the full project duration from beginning to end, including all project stages: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. If projects have multiple phases, all of these stages are repeated in each phase.

- Process Groups . These are the technical names for the project stages: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing.


## Understanding Projects

-  An operation is an ongoing and repetitive set of tasks, whereas a project has a lifecycle—a beginning and an end.

- “a project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.” So, a project has two defining characteristics: it is temporary, and it creates a unique product.

- It is important to understand that projects and operations share some characteristics, such as the following: Both require resources, including human resources, i.e., people. Both are constrained to limited, as opposed to unlimited, resources. Both are managed—that is, planned, executed, and controlled. Both have objectives and contribute to meeting the company’s strategic objectives. Both can have and share stakeholders.

- Operations are generally ongoing and repetitive. Although both projects and operations have objectives, a project ends when its objectives are met, whereas an operation continues contributing to objectives


### ORIGINS OF PROJECTS: WHERE DO PROJECTS COME FROM?

- Projects are originated by organizational leaders in response to one or more situations the organization is facing. These situations, or factors acting on the organization, may fall into one of the following four categories: Business/legal requirements, Stakeholder requests or needs, Business or technological strategies, Products, processes, or services. (...) the project may fall into more than one of these categories.

- The factors discussed in this section not only influence the organization’s current business strategies but also its current operations because operations are there to serve business strategies or objectives.

## Understanding Project Management

- Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.

### UNDERSTANDING PROGRESSIVE ELABORATION

- The clearer the vision you have of the unique product that you want from the project, the more accurate the project plan will be. So, you move toward the project plan in incremental steps as the ideas about the final product are refined and as you get more and more information about the requirements in a progressive fashion. This procedure of defining (or planning) a project is called progressive elaboration.

- Progressive elaboration, in general, means developing something in incremental steps. The project plan will be broadly defined to start and will get more accurate, detailed, and explicit in an incremental fashion as better understanding about the project deliverables and objectives develops. It involves successive iterations of the planning process, which result in a more accurate and complete plan.

### UNDERSTANDING A PROCESS

-  a process, in general, is a set of interrelated activities performed to obtain a specified set of products, results, or services. A project management process, (...) always consists of three parts: input, tools and techniques, and output.

- 1. Iterations. Some processes, such as Develop Project Charter and Close Project, are run only once or at predetermined points in the process, while others, such as Conduct Procurements and Acquire Recourses, may be periodically run depending on the project size. Yet processes like Define Activities may be even more frequently performed.

- 2. Process Interconnect. Processes are connected with other processes by input or output. An output item of a process becomes an input to an other process or a terminal output; i.e., a project or phase deliverable.

- 3. Overlapping. Some of the input items may appear in multiple projects. This is also true for tools or techniques. From this, you can see that processes may overlap in their activities.

## Understanding the Project Lifecycle

- The timespan from the project’s beginning to its end is called the project lifecycle.

- In the standard terminology, a project is initiated, planned, executed, monitored and controlled, and closed.

- From initiation/authorization to completion/closure, a project goes through a whole lifecycle that includes defining the project objectives, planning the work to achieve those objectives, performing the work, monitoring and controlling the progress, and closing the project after receiving product acceptance.

### INITIATING A PROJECT

-  The central purpose of this stage is to align the project’s purpose with the business needs and the organization’s business strategy on one hand and with the stakeholders’ expectations on the other.

- It is good policy to involve customers and other important stakeholders in the initiating stage of the project. It will give them a feeling of shared ownership that will greatly contribute to the success of the project by positively influencing factors such as acceptance of deliverables and stakeholder satisfaction.

- The processes in the initiating process group, just like those in any other process group, can also be used to initiate a phase of a project that has multiple phases.

### PLANNING THE PROJECT

- In this stage, you, the project manager, along with the project management team , develop the project scope, define and refine the project objectives, and develop activities to meet those objectives. 

- The approved scope plan, schedule plan, and cost plan are called the scope baseline, schedule baseline, and cost baseline, respectively. These three baselines together are called the project baseline or the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The project performance at any time is assessed by comparing the results from project execution against this performance measurement baseline (PMB). 

### EXECUTING THE PROJECT

- In this stage, you, the project manager, manage the execution of the project as planned in the project management plan.

- The processes in this group are used to accomplish a three-pronged goal: Coordinate people and resources used to perform the project activities. Integrate and manage the project activities being performed. Ensure the implementation of the project scope and approved changes.

- The lion’s share of project resources is consumed in performing processes from the executing process group.

- In general, the execution of the project needs to be monitored and controlled to ensure the project stays on the planned track.

### MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT

- You monitor and control the project throughout its lifecycle, including during the executing stage. The purpose of monitoring and controlling is to make sure that the project stays on track. To accomplish this, you continually perform the following steps:

- 1. Collect the actual project performance data.

- 2. Analyze it to compare the results against the project performance baseline to measure project deviation from the plan.

- 3. Based on deviation, generate change requests, e.g.; recommend preventive and corrective actions, and process them for approval followed by implementation.

### CLOSING THE PROJECT

- In this stage, you verify that all the required project processes are complete, all project-related contracts are closed, the outcome of the project is turned over to another group, and you can bring the project to an end by disbanding the project team. Closing the project also includes conducting a project review for lessons learned.

- What we refer to as project stages here are not the project phases. A project phase is a part of the whole project in which certain milestones or project deliverables are completed. All these stages, technically called process groups, can be applied to any phase of a project that is divided into multiple phases.

- The processes of the closing process group can be used to close a project, as well as to close a phase of a project.

- Each process is a two-dimensional entity. It belongs to both a certain project stage (group) and a specific process knowledge area.


## Understanding Project Management Knowledge Areas

- To manage projects, you use project management knowledge, which is categorized into multiple aspects; each category is called a project management knowledge area.

- Project integration management. The project is initiated, planned, and executed in pieces using different knowledge areas, and all those pieces are related to each other and need to be come together. That is where integration management comes in.

- Project scope management. The primary purpose of project scope management is to ensure that all the required work, and only the required work, is performed to complete the project. 

- Project schedule management. The primary purpose of project schedule management is to develop and manage the project schedule so as to complete the project in time as planned. 

- Project resource management. The primary purpose of project resource management is to identify, obtain, and manage the resources needed to complete the project. The term resources resources refers to both human resources and physical resources

- Project cost management. The primary task of project cost management is to estimate and control the project costs, and the primary goal is to complete the project within the approved budget. 

- Project stakeholder management. The primary purpose of project stakeholder management is to identify project stakeholders and manage and monitor their engagement in the project. 

- Project communication management. It is absolutely imperative for the success of the project that project information is generated and distributed, i.e., communicated, in a timely fashion. Some would say communication is the most important aspect of a project and the most important skill for a project manager to have. 

- Project quality management. This process group offers three processes to manage quality: plan quality to determine the quality requirements and standards that are relevant to the project at hand; manage quality to ensure that the planned quality requirements and standards are applied; and control quality to verify that the project and its deliverables meet the quality requirements and conform to the quality standards.

- Project risk management. A project risk is an event that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives. The primary purpose of project risk management is to identify risks and respond to them should they occur. 

- Project procurement management. The primary purpose of procurement management is to manage the acquisition of products (that is, products, services, or results) from outside the project team in order to complete the project.

- As you have seen, managing a project largely means performing a set of processes at various stages of the project, such as initiating and planning. Accordingly, processes are grouped corresponding to these stages, and these groups are called process groups. Processes are also part of the knowledge required to manage projects. Each of these processes belongs to one of the ten knowledge areas identified in the PMBOK Guide, Sixth Edition. So, a process has a dual membership—one in a process group, indicating at what stage of the project the process is performed, and the other in a knowledge area,

## Triangular Relationship: Project, Program, and Portfolio

- Program. A program may be defined as a set of interrelated projects all working toward the same set of objectives. These projects are put into a program to reap the benefits of managing them in a coordinated way that would not be available by managing them individually. 

- Portfolio. A portfolio is a higher-level structure that may contain projects, programs, subportfolios, and operations and is managed by a portfolio manager. These components are put together in a portfolio to facilitate effective management in order to implement the strategic business plan of the organization.

- Portfolio management focuses on making sure that programs and projects are prioritized for resources to serve the organization’s strategy. Therefore, investment decisions are usually made at the portfolio level. One task of portfolio management is to select the optimal set of programs and projects to meet the strategic objectives, on one hand, and to increase the likelihood of realizing the desired return on investment, on the other hand. It also provides centralized management of the aggregate risk of all profile components.

- Even if an organization does not have any programs and has only individual projects, all these projects can be grouped into one or more portfolios.

- If an organization has programs and no individual projects external to all programs, all these programs can be grouped into one or more portfolios.

- If an organization has some programs and some individual projects, all these programs and projects can be grouped into one or more portfolios.

- As compared to projects and programs, a portfolio is closer to an organization’s business objectives, and therefore this is where most of the investment decisions are made.

### PROBABILITY-RELATED CONCEPTS

### GLOBAL PROJECT VARIABLES

- Cost and number of team members (staff). This is low in the beginning because the project is just in the preparation stage, reaches a maximum when the project is being executed—that is, when most work is done—and drops rapidly when the project draws to a close because most of the work has already have done.

- Ability to influence the characteristics of the project product. Your or any other stakeholder’s ability to influence the project product characteristics without significantly changing the cost is the highest in the beginning because not much has been done yet in any direction. However, this ability gradually decreases as the project progresses because we have already invested in a given direction.

- Risk and uncertainty. This is highest in the beginning because there are plenty of unknowns and assumptions. It decreases as the project progresses as unknowns start disappearing and details start appearing as a result of the principle of progressive elaboration. This is true about both risk and uncertainty, as risks arise from uncertainty, which at least partially arises from assumptions.

- The project baseline is defined as the approved plan for certain aspects of the project, such as the cost, schedule, and scope of the project. The project performance is measured against this baseline.

## Big Picture of Project Management

- A project, whether standalone or part of a program or a portfolio, is performed to contribute to meeting the strategic objectives of an organization.

- The project lifecycle consists of five stages, technically called process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Depending on the project, these stages may repeat in different phases.

- The project processes that are performed to manage projects make up ten project management knowledge areas: integration management, scope management, time management, cost management, resource management, communication management, stakeholder management, quality management, risk management, and procurement management.

- The big picture of project management: the aspects of a project that need to be managed at different stages of the project lifecycle by using processes


# 2. Project Environment

- Although you use your knowledge in terms of processes to manage projects, the management will be greatly influenced by the environment in which the project runs, such as the structure and culture of the performing organization. Projects also originate from their environments.

- a given project is performed in a certain environment; e.g.; it runs in an organization with its own structure and culture, in a certain location with its own culture and laws. This part of the environment is called the enterprise environment factors (EEF). Now, the organization has some assets, such as knowledge, policy and procedures, and processes, to start the project and support it through its lifecycle. This part of the project environment is called the organizational process assets (OPA).

- Think of influence like a force, and when a force is applied to anything, it has an impact on that thing.

- Enterprise Environment Factors (EEF) . Enterprise environmental factors are factors that are related to the environment either internal or external to the performing organization and that can influence and potentially impact the project. Some examples are the organization’s structure and culture and any city culture conditions external to the organization. The EEF are external to the project.

- Organizational Project Assets (OPA) . These are the processes or process-related assets of the project-performing organization that can be used to help the project succeed. Procedures, templates, and lessons-learned databases developed from previous projects are some examples. The OPA are internal to the organization and external to the project.

- Project Stakeholders . Stakeholders can be both internal and external to the organization and the project. The project team and project sponsor in the organization are examples of internal stakeholders, and customers the external.

## Identifying Environmental Factors and Process Assets and Their Influence on Process

- Identifying the environmental factors is only part of the job, as you must effectively use the positive factors to help the project and try to take action to minimize the effect of negative factors on the project. Note that environmental factors can be internal to the performing organization, such as the organization’s culture, or external to the organization, such as market conditions. However, the organizational process assets are internal only.

## Introducing the Project Stakeholders

### IDENTIFYING PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS

- Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose interests are affected (positively or negatively) by the project execution and completion. 

- If we consider, for simplicity, only two cases: a project stakeholder has something to gain from the project or something to lose to the project. Accordingly, these stakeholders fall into two categories—positive stakeholders, who will normally benefit from the success of the project, and negative stakeholders, who will see some kind of disadvantage coming from the project.

- Do not confuse the project management team with the project team. The project management team consists of individuals involved in the project management tasks. It is a subset of the project team, which includes members of the project management team and also other members, such as those who perform the actual work of the project.

### LEADERSHIP SKILLS

- In a traditional organizational structure, such as a functional structure, project managers do not have formal authority over the project team members who perform the team’s work. So, you have no other choice than to manage by leadership and not by authority or power. The good news is that managing by leadership is overall more effective and productive than managing by authority anyway

- Visionary. Visualize the product and how it fits into the big picture of the organization’s strategy, and be able to translate this vision for the team. Have a holistic big-picture view of the project , accounting for all internal and external factors.

### PROJECT BUSINESS CASE

- This document makes the case for the would-be project from a business perspective by providing necessary information that can be used to assess whether the expected project outcome is worth the required investment. It includes the business need, project objectives, and success criterion. 

- In summary, a business case presents and analyzes a problem or an opportunity in the context of the organization’s strategy; proposes alternative courses of action and the criterion of how to select one out of these; based on this criterion, recommend one and state how to measure the benefits and success of the project that would come out of the recommended course of action.

### PROJECT BENEFIT MANAGEMENT PLAN

- The project benefit management plan document describes what, when, and how project benefits would be delivered, as well as how they would be measured. 

- The project manager must keep the general management approach in harmony with the theme of the business case and the project benefit management plan documents, which are interdependent and are developed iteratively and maintained through the project lifecycle.

## Summary

- In an organization, a project is born out of the need to address a problem or an opportunity while staying in alignment with the organization’s strategy. The project is born and performed in a certain environment constituted by three components: enterprise environmental factors (EEF), organizational process assets (OPA), and project stakeholders. EEFs are environmental factors, which can be internal to the organization, such as organizational structure and culture, or external to the organization, such as the law of the land where the organization is located. However, OPAs are only internal to the organization and of two types: processes, policy, and procedures; and knowledge database repositories. The project manager cannot change policy and procedures but can add to the knowledge databases. Enterprise environmental factors are related to how the performing organization does its business, whereas organizational process assets are specific to how the organization runs its projects.

- Project environment influences and hence impacts the project. As a project is being influenced and impacted by its environment, it or its outcome influence and impact back some element of the environment. The goal of project management is to manage the influence of the environment on the project in such a way that the project influences back to change the business-value state of the organization to a higher level.

# 3. Project Integration Management

## Integration Management: Big Picture

- By now, we already know that most of project management is performed through processes. However, project management is not just a collection of processes that you run one after the other and then are done. These processes depend on each other—i.e., they are logically linked to each other by outputs and input—and many of them need to be iterated several times based on the need. This implies that we need to oversee or coordinate the processes that we run to perform the day-to-day project management. The integration management knowledge area offers processes to accomplish just that; in other words, to define, identify, coordinate, and integrate various activities and processes within each project management process group

- It is noteworthy that integration management is the only knowledge area to have processes in every process group; i.e., in all stages of the project lifecycle.

- The project charter is a document that contains the high-level project information, such as the project’s purpose, objectives, and preapproved financial resources. The single most important reason why this document is produced—using the Develop Project Charter process—is to receive the formal authorization for the project. To accomplish this, it is necessary that the charter clearly shows the business need for the project and that the project objectives align with the organization’s strategic objectives. For this purpose,

## Developing the Project Charter

- The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project, and includes naming the project manager, determining the authority level of the project manager, and allowing the project manager to start using organizational resources on the project.

- To summarize, the input items to developing the project charter may include two business documents—project business case and project benefit management plan—enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, and possibly a contract or some other form of agreement. You take the available inputs and apply the relevant tools and techniques to develop the project charter.

### OUTPUT OF DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER

- The output of the Develop Project Charter process contains two items—assumptions log and project charter—

- Assumptions Log . This item contains assumptions and constraints mostly at a strategic and operational level. They are usually recorded in the business case document and can also come from expert judgment. When the project starts, the assumptions log grows as lower-level assumptions are made due to a lack of details that affect cost estimate, schedule, plans, and so on. Assumptions are important as they give rise to risks. An assumption is a factor that you consider to be true without any proof or verification.

- Project Charter. It is a high-level document that summarizes information about the project and its intended outcome. 

- the project charter provides the project manager with the authority to use organizational resources to run the project. Remember that, formally speaking, project charters are prepared external to project management by an individual, a committee in the organization, or the PMO. In other words, project management starts where the project charter ends.

- Once you have the project charter, you know the high-level product requirements that the project will satisfy. However, a high-level requirement written in a certain way might mean different things to different stakeholders. So, after you get the project charter, one of your next tasks will be to develop a common understanding of the project among the project stakeholders. You accomplish this by drawing or explaining boundaries around the project at a lower level—that is, what is included and what is not—thereby spelling out what exactly the deliverables are. By doing this, you are determining the scope of the project at the lower level.

## Developing the Project Management Plan

- So, once the project has been initiated, it is time to do some planning. Project planning starts with the process of Develop Project Management Plan, which defines, prepares, coordinates, and integrates all subsidiary plans, such as scope and risk management plans, into one plan called the project management plan. 

- One necessary item in the plan is the baseline for at least the following project features: scope, time, and cost.

- The project management plan provides the basis of all the needed project work and how it will be performed.

## Directing and Managing Project Work

- The project work defined and scheduled in the project management plan is performed using the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. 

- The three main functions of directing and managing project work are as follows: (1) Execute the planned project activities to produce deliverables in order to meet the project objectives. (2) Produce work performance and related change requests. (3) Implement the approved changes, defect repairs, and other actions.

### INPUT TO DIRECTING AND MANAGING PROJECT WORK

- The project work defined and scheduled in the project management plan is performed using the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.

- In a nutshell, the project management plan and approved change requests are the major inputs to directing and managing project work because executing the project is all about implementing the project management plan along with the approved change requests.

### OUTPUT OF DIRECTING AND MANAGING PROJECT WORK

- Deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and identifiable project outcome (i.e., product, service, or result) identified in the project management plan that must be generated to complete the project. The core purpose of executing the project management plan is to produce deliverables.

- Issue Log . Throughout the project, you will face issues, e.g.; problems, inconsistencies, and conflicts. These issues need to be resolved so they do not start impacting the project negatively. To start the process, you enter an issue into an issue log with the following information: issue type, who raised the issue and when, issue description, priority, who the issue is assigned to, target resolution date, status, and final resolution.

- These change requests might come from inside or outside the performing organization and can be optional or mandated legally or contractually. These change requests must be approved before they can be processed and implemented

- The key benefit of the Direct and Manage Project Work process is that it provides overall management of the project work and the resulting deliverables in an integrated way. This improves the odds of project success.

### MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECT WORK

- The most important overall goal of the Monitor and Control Project Work process is to make sure that the project remains aligned with the organization’s business need from which it originated.

### Input to Monitor and Control Project Work

- The major inputs to this process are the project management plan, to look for any aspect of the project, and work performance data for analysis that comes from directing and managing the project work. We also have project documents, including 1) milestone list with scheduled dates for specific milestones to check if they are being met; 2) project schedule forecasts to determine if the project is within defined schedule tolerance ranges; 3) basis of estimates for information on how the various estimates are made and how they can be used to determine responses to variances; 4) cost forecasts for project’s past performance, used to determine if the project is within the defined budget tolerance ranges and to identify any necessary change requests; 5) issue log shows who is responsible for resolving specific issues by a target date; 6) assumptions log for information on assumptions and constraints identified as affecting the project; 7) change log that contains the status of all change requests; 8) risk register for information on threats and opportunities that could possibly impact project execution; 9) risk report for information on the overall project risks and also on specific individual risks, such as risk sources; 10) quality reports for information on quality management issues, corrective actions, recommendations for project, processes, and product improvements, and summary of findings from the Control Quality process; 11) lessons learned register for information on effective responses for variances, as well as corrective and preventive actions.

### Output for Monitor and Control Project Work

- Original change requests, such as in project scope, product scope, or cost line, if approved, can trigger other changes, such as those to the project management plan, project documents, or product deliverables.

## Performing Integrated Change Control

- The Perform Integrated Change Control process is all about processing change requests, which includes evaluating them; deferring, rejecting, or approving them; and managing the implementation of approved changes and the changes resulting from this implementation.

- Regardless of where they originate, it is the project manager’s responsibility to manage all the changes, which includes getting the changes rejected or approved, ensuring the approved changes get implemented, and changing the affected plans and documents accordingly.

- The Perform Integrated Change Control process is used to manage changes to the project from project initiation through project closure.

- The key benefit of this process is that the changes get documented; they are considered, deferred, rejected, or approved; approved ones are implemented in the entire context of the project; and changes resulting from the implementation are managed. This reduces the risk that would prevail absent this process.

### OUTPUT FROM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL

- Approved Change Requests. You must make sure not only that the approved change requests are implemented through the Direct and Manage Project Work process, but also that the status or info about the deferred and rejected change requests are communicated to the stakeholders who requested the change.

## Managing Project Knowledge

- The Manage Project Knowledge process is used to help meet the project objectives and contribute to organizational knowledge and learning by creating new knowledge and using existing knowledge.

- From the definition of Manage Project Knowledge, it should be clear that managing knowledge is not just about recording or documenting the knowledge to share it, nor is it just about yielding the lessons learned to be used in the future projects.

- In fact, the most important task and challenge of knowledge management is to create an environment where people trust each other and are motivated to learn and share knowledge.

### OUTPUT OF MANAGING PROJECT KNOWLEDGE

- The key benefits of the Manage Project Knowledge process is that new knowledge is created or existing organizational knowledge is improved, and in the process of this creation or improvement the existing knowledge is used. Moreover, the created or improved knowledge is used in the organization’s operations and in future projects or future phases of the current project.

## Performing Project Closure

- Project closure includes ensuring that all the planned work is completed, the planned outcome has been delivered, the project or phase information is archived with the organization, and team resources are released. You also need to determine and coordinate the procedures required for verifying and documenting the project deliverables.

### INPUT TO THE CLOSE PROJECT PROCESS

- It’s important to understand the flow of project deliverables through different processes. They are generated by the Direct and Manage Project Work process, verified through the Quality Control process, accepted by the customer through the Validate Scope process, and transitioned to the appropriate party through the Close Project or Phase process.

## Summary

- The project is initiated, planned, and executed in pieces, and all those pieces are related to each other and need to come together. That is where integration management comes in, which includes developing the project charter, developing the project management plan, directing and managing project work, monitoring and controlling project work, performing integrated change control, managing project knowledge, and closing the project or a phase of the project. You develop the project charter based on two business documents, namely business case and project benefit management plan, hence interfacing the project with the organization’s business need and with the project charter. Then, you develop the project management plan by taking the project charter and output of many other planning processes as input. The project management plan becomes an input to all other integration processes. This virtually means that executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the project are equivalent to implementing the project management plan.

- As a project manager, you manage project execution using the Direct and Manage Project Work process, which will generate change requests that must be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process that in turn sends approved change requests back to the Direct and Manage Project Work process for implementation. The Direct and Manage Project Work process also produces the work performance data that is used by the Monitor and Control Project Work process to generate performance reports and more change requests. These and the change requests directly from stakeholders also must be processed though the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Moreover, directing and managing project work also generates deliverables, which, after verification and validation, become input to the Close Project or Phase process.

- The lessons learned are the output of two processes: Manage Project Knowledge and Close Project or Phase. The lessons are learned throughout the project by performing the Manage Project Knowledge process, and not only at the end of the project or phase.


# 4. Project Scope Management

- you need to collect requirements based on the needs and expectations of the stakeholders and in line with the project objectives. Once you have defined the scope based on these requirements, it needs to be broken down into concrete, manageable tasks that can be assigned and performed. This is accomplished through what is called the work breakdown structure (WBS).

- The primary purpose of project scope management is to ensure that the required work (and only the required work) is performed to complete the project successfully.

## Managing Scope: Big Picture

- The project scope is defined as the work that must be performed to deliver a product with a given scope. The product scope is the set of functions and features that characterize a product to be delivered by the project. 

- The major goal of scope management is to ensure that the required work and only the required work is included and performed in the project.

### DEVELOPING THE PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN

- Before performing the five scope management processes, you must develop the scope management plan, a blueprint that will show how to develop, control, and validate the scope. As mentioned previously, this plan is developed using the Plan Scope Management process

- You must develop this plan in the context of the purpose of the project, which is documented in the project charter, where you will also find a high-level project description and high-level requirements along with other relevant information, such as assumptions and constraints. Also, you will need the project management plan in the input for the quality management plan, details of the project lifecycle, and a development approach. All three will impact how you plan the scope management. Development approach refers to the development approach or approaches adapted for this project, such as agile, waterfalls, or iterative. The plan scope management process will also be influenced by EEFs (Enterprise Environmental Factors) like personnel administration, culture, and infrastructure of the organization, along with marketing conditions. Of course, speaking of OPAs (Organizational Process Assets), this plan will be developed by following the organizational policies and procedures, and you will make use of historical information, including lessons learned from past projects.

### REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN AND SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN

- The requirement management plan basically describes the collect requirements process: how to collect, determine, and document the project and product requirements and plan to manage those requirements.

- Similarly, the scope management plan describes the “how to” details regarding the rest of the scope management processes: define scope, create work breakdown structure, control scope, and validate scope.

- It’s important to realize that product scope and project scope are not independent. Product scope is the set of functions and features that fully define the product, and project scope is the work required to deliver the product. So, the product scope more or less determines the project scope.

## Collecting Requirements for the Project

- A requirement is a condition, characteristic, or capability that a specific outcome of the project must have. 

- How effective you are in capturing requirements will determine how effective you are in getting agreement on these requirements from the stakeholders and in managing the stakeholders’ expectations and needs. Also, these requirements go right into the foundations of the WBS, along with the deliverables. Therefore, collecting requirements effectively is critical for the success of the project.

### TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR COLLECTING REQUIREMENTS

#### Prototyping

- Prototypes can also be used to collect requirements by experimenting with the prototype and letting stakeholders experiment with it and offer feedback. It’s more tangible than the abstract idea of a product. Prototypes can be improved and modified based on the feedback from the stakeholders. In this way, prototypes support the progressive elaboration process of developing requirements.

### OUTPUT OF COLLECTING REQUIREMENTS

#### Requirement Documentation

- This documentation consists of a list of requirements and any necessary details for each item in the list.

- Business Requirements. It describes the business need for which the process was started; e.g.; the overall purpose of the project, such as the opportunity being seized or the business problem being solved.

- Project Requirements. These are about the project-related processes, needs, and conditions, such as milestone data and other conditions in the contract.

- Solution Requirements. These are of two types: 1) functional requirements, referring to the functionality of the project outcome—e.g.; what the product does, its feature; and 2) non-functional requirements, such as compliance, compatibility, support, reliability, safety, and performance.

- Stakeholder Requirements are based on the needs of all or part of the stakeholders.

- Quality Requirements such as not allowing more than three bugs per software module.

- Support and Training Requirements such as the product will be released with a manual.

- Impact of the Requirements. This element describes the impact of requirements on the project and on entities external to the project, such as different groups in the organization.

## Defining the Project Scope

### INPUT TO SCOPE DEFINITION

- The purpose of the Define Scope process is to figure out the detailed descriptions of the project and its product.

### OUTPUT OF SCOPE DEFINITION

- Depending on the input, the scope definition process can generate two kinds of output: the project scope statement, which contains the original scope definition, and approved updates to some project documents. Recall that the project scope statement is a component of the baseline used to manage change requests to the project.

- The project scope statement contains both the project scope and the project product scope.

#### Project Scope Statement

- The key output item of the Define Project process is the project scope statement, which includes the project scope as well as the product scope

- Product Scope Description. Product scope is defined as description of features, functions, and other characteristics a project product.

- Product Acceptance Criteria. This defines the process, criteria, and conditions for accepting the completed products that the project will deliver.

- Project Assumptions and Constraints. Assumptions and constraints are initially included in the project charter. However, at this stage, you have more information about the project and therefore can revisit the initial assumptions and constraints; you might be able to identify more assumptions and constraints. You should document the specific assumptions related to the project scope and also analyze their impact in case they turn out to be false. Due to the uncertainty built into them, assumptions are potential sources of risk.

- Constraints related to the project scope must also be documented in the scope statement. Because constraints limit the team’s options, the constraints’ impact on the project must be evaluated. The constraints can come from various sources, such as a predetermined deadline (also called hard deadline) for the completion of the project or a milestone, limits on the funds available for the project, and contractual provisions.

- Project Deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and verifiable project outcome, such as a product, a capability to provide a service, or a result. It may be required to be produced to complete a project, a process, or a phase of the project. The deliverables may also include related material, such as manuals and other documentation. The scope statement provides the list of deliverables and their descriptions.

- Project Exclusions. This involves drawing boundaries around the project by specifying what is included and what is not, especially focusing on the gray areas where stakeholders may make their own assumptions, different from each other’s. It generally identifies what is excluded from the project, which helps to manage stakeholder expectations.

- You must be able to make a distinction between objectives, deliverables, and requirements. For example, in a project to launch a website, the site is a deliverable. That the site must print a warning message at the login time is a requirement, and that the site should increase the company revenue by 3 percent is an objective.

- It serves as a component of the baseline that will be used to evaluate whether a request for a change or additional work falls within or beyond the scope of the project; hence, helps with avoiding scope creep.

- In general, it helps with making project decisions throughout the lifecycle of the project.

- By providing a common understanding of the project scope, the scope statement helps bring the stakeholders onto the same page in their expectations.

- Because the scope statement describes the deliverables and the work required to create those deliverables, it is used to create a WBS, which helps in scheduling the project.

- It serves as a guide for the project team to do more-detailed planning.

- From the perspective of actually performing the work, the scope statement is still a high-level document. To be able to schedule the project, identify and assign resources, and manage the project successfully, these deliverables need to be broken down into manageable tasks. This is accomplished by creating an entity called the work breakdown structure (WBS).

## Creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- a WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy of the work that must be performed to accomplish the objectives of and create the deliverables for the project.

### DECOMPOSITION

- Decomposition is a technique for subdividing the project deliverables into smaller, manageable tasks called work packages. 

- 1.Identify the deliverables and the work involved by analyzing the project scope statement and requirement documentation. 
- 2.Understand the relationships among the deliverables. 
- 3.Structure and organize the first level (just below the root of the hierarchical tree) of the WBS hierarchy. Based on the project at hand, you can use one of the following approaches; e.g.; use the deliverables as the components in the first level or use the phases of the project as the components in the first level. 
- 4.Decompose the upper level into more-detailed components for the lower level. 
- 5.Keep decomposing to lower levels until necessary and sufficient decomposition has been achieved. 
- 6.Assign identification codes to the WBS components.

- excessive decomposition leads to inefficient use of management and other resources. Necessary and sufficient decomposition is the key.

- While using the technique of decomposition, remember a useful concept or trick: rolling wave planning. It’s a fancy term that refers to handling a deliverable or its subcomponent that cannot be decomposed further currently because we don’t know the details about it yet; (...) We leave the decomposition of such a deliverable at a level allowed by the available information and wait on further decomposition until more information becomes available. 

### OUTPUT OF CREATING WBS

#### SCOPE BASELINE

- Project Scope Statement. This document includes project and product scope description, project deliverables, product acceptance criteria, and project assumptions and constraints.

- Work Breakdown Structure. As explained earlier, the WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical structure that decomposes the project scope and deliverables into the work packages that will be executed by the project team to create the planned deliverables and in this way accomplish the planned project objectives. The project manager creates this document with the help of the project team.

- Work Packages and Control Account. Remember, at the lowest part of each branch in WBS we have work packages, each of which is assigned a unique identifier. To this identifier is attached information about schedule, resources, and cost for this work package, and it acts as a code of account. In other words, each work package represents a deliverable or a component of it, with schedule, resources, and cost attached. Using one or more such points or codes of account, information on schedule, resources, and cost for a group of work packages can be summed or integrated and managed. This way, each package control point becomes a part of what is called the control account for that group of work packages. A control account represents a control management point where scope, schedule, and cost are integrated for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the performance; e.g.; comparing with earned value.

- A control account may contain one or more work packages, but a work package can have membership in only one control account. This means that a control account is in some package above the work packages and contains all the work packages below it in the branch to which it belongs.

- the end goal of the WBS is to specify the project scope in terms of work packages; this is what distinguishes the WBS from other information breakdown structures.

- The approved version of the scope baseline becomes a component of the project management plan and can be changed only through the formal change control procedure, i.e., running the processes. It plays a crucial role in determining many aspects of the project, such as schedule, cost, quality, and procurement.

## Controlling Scope

- Controlling the project scope is all about keeping a tab on the status of the project scope and product scope as well as managing changes to the scope baseline.

- Watch out for scope creep. Determine whether it has happened and correct the situation. Scope creep refers to scope changes applied without processing them though the change control process.

- Process the scope change requests through the integrated change control process for approval.

- Manage the implementation of scope changes after approval, as well as their impact across the project.

## Validating the Scope of Project Deliverables

- Validating scope is the process of formally accepting the completed project deliverables, which have already been verified for their correctness by using the control quality process. Before you hand over the project deliverables to the appropriate party mentioned in the project management plan, such as the customer or the sponsor, you need to validate with the party that the deliverables actually meet the planned scope.

- Do not confuse scope validation with quality control or scope verification performed using quality control, which is primarily focused on checking the correctness of the deliverables and other quality requirements; scope validation is about ensuring that the entire scope with the requirements with have implicated.

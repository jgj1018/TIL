# 1. Project Management Framework

## Basic Concepts in Project Management

- Project. A project is a work effort made over a finite period of time with a start and a finish to create a unique product, service, or result. Because a project has a start and an end, it is also called a temporary effort or endeavor.

- Project Phase. A project phase is a set of logically related activities that usually completes one or more major deliverables of the project. The phases are generally completed in sequence; however, an overlap is possible in some situations. Depending on its size and complexity, a project may have one or more phases.

- Project Life Cycle. It is the full project duration from beginning to end, including all project stages: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. If projects have multiple phases, all of these stages are repeated in each phase.

- Process Groups . These are the technical names for the project stages: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing.


## Understanding Projects

-  An operation is an ongoing and repetitive set of tasks, whereas a project has a lifecycle—a beginning and an end.

- “a project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.” So, a project has two defining characteristics: it is temporary, and it creates a unique product.

- It is important to understand that projects and operations share some characteristics, such as the following: Both require resources, including human resources, i.e., people. Both are constrained to limited, as opposed to unlimited, resources. Both are managed—that is, planned, executed, and controlled. Both have objectives and contribute to meeting the company’s strategic objectives. Both can have and share stakeholders.

- Operations are generally ongoing and repetitive. Although both projects and operations have objectives, a project ends when its objectives are met, whereas an operation continues contributing to objectives


### ORIGINS OF PROJECTS: WHERE DO PROJECTS COME FROM?

- Projects are originated by organizational leaders in response to one or more situations the organization is facing. These situations, or factors acting on the organization, may fall into one of the following four categories: Business/legal requirements, Stakeholder requests or needs, Business or technological strategies, Products, processes, or services. (...) the project may fall into more than one of these categories.

- The factors discussed in this section not only influence the organization’s current business strategies but also its current operations because operations are there to serve business strategies or objectives.

## Understanding Project Management

- Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.

### UNDERSTANDING PROGRESSIVE ELABORATION

- The clearer the vision you have of the unique product that you want from the project, the more accurate the project plan will be. So, you move toward the project plan in incremental steps as the ideas about the final product are refined and as you get more and more information about the requirements in a progressive fashion. This procedure of defining (or planning) a project is called progressive elaboration.

- Progressive elaboration, in general, means developing something in incremental steps. The project plan will be broadly defined to start and will get more accurate, detailed, and explicit in an incremental fashion as better understanding about the project deliverables and objectives develops. It involves successive iterations of the planning process, which result in a more accurate and complete plan.

### UNDERSTANDING A PROCESS

-  a process, in general, is a set of interrelated activities performed to obtain a specified set of products, results, or services. A project management process, (...) always consists of three parts: input, tools and techniques, and output.

- 1. Iterations. Some processes, such as Develop Project Charter and Close Project, are run only once or at predetermined points in the process, while others, such as Conduct Procurements and Acquire Recourses, may be periodically run depending on the project size. Yet processes like Define Activities may be even more frequently performed.

- 2. Process Interconnect. Processes are connected with other processes by input or output. An output item of a process becomes an input to an other process or a terminal output; i.e., a project or phase deliverable.

- 3. Overlapping. Some of the input items may appear in multiple projects. This is also true for tools or techniques. From this, you can see that processes may overlap in their activities.

## Understanding the Project Lifecycle

- The timespan from the project’s beginning to its end is called the project lifecycle.

- In the standard terminology, a project is initiated, planned, executed, monitored and controlled, and closed.

- From initiation/authorization to completion/closure, a project goes through a whole lifecycle that includes defining the project objectives, planning the work to achieve those objectives, performing the work, monitoring and controlling the progress, and closing the project after receiving product acceptance.

### INITIATING A PROJECT

-  The central purpose of this stage is to align the project’s purpose with the business needs and the organization’s business strategy on one hand and with the stakeholders’ expectations on the other.

- It is good policy to involve customers and other important stakeholders in the initiating stage of the project. It will give them a feeling of shared ownership that will greatly contribute to the success of the project by positively influencing factors such as acceptance of deliverables and stakeholder satisfaction.

- The processes in the initiating process group, just like those in any other process group, can also be used to initiate a phase of a project that has multiple phases.

### PLANNING THE PROJECT

- In this stage, you, the project manager, along with the project management team , develop the project scope, define and refine the project objectives, and develop activities to meet those objectives. 

- The approved scope plan, schedule plan, and cost plan are called the scope baseline, schedule baseline, and cost baseline, respectively. These three baselines together are called the project baseline or the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The project performance at any time is assessed by comparing the results from project execution against this performance measurement baseline (PMB). 

### EXECUTING THE PROJECT

- In this stage, you, the project manager, manage the execution of the project as planned in the project management plan.

- The processes in this group are used to accomplish a three-pronged goal: Coordinate people and resources used to perform the project activities. Integrate and manage the project activities being performed. Ensure the implementation of the project scope and approved changes.

- The lion’s share of project resources is consumed in performing processes from the executing process group.

- In general, the execution of the project needs to be monitored and controlled to ensure the project stays on the planned track.

### MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE PROJECT

- You monitor and control the project throughout its lifecycle, including during the executing stage. The purpose of monitoring and controlling is to make sure that the project stays on track. To accomplish this, you continually perform the following steps:

- 1. Collect the actual project performance data.

- 2. Analyze it to compare the results against the project performance baseline to measure project deviation from the plan.

- 3. Based on deviation, generate change requests, e.g.; recommend preventive and corrective actions, and process them for approval followed by implementation.

### CLOSING THE PROJECT

- In this stage, you verify that all the required project processes are complete, all project-related contracts are closed, the outcome of the project is turned over to another group, and you can bring the project to an end by disbanding the project team. Closing the project also includes conducting a project review for lessons learned.

- What we refer to as project stages here are not the project phases. A project phase is a part of the whole project in which certain milestones or project deliverables are completed. All these stages, technically called process groups, can be applied to any phase of a project that is divided into multiple phases.

- The processes of the closing process group can be used to close a project, as well as to close a phase of a project.

- Each process is a two-dimensional entity. It belongs to both a certain project stage (group) and a specific process knowledge area.


## Understanding Project Management Knowledge Areas

- To manage projects, you use project management knowledge, which is categorized into multiple aspects; each category is called a project management knowledge area.

- Project integration management. The project is initiated, planned, and executed in pieces using different knowledge areas, and all those pieces are related to each other and need to be come together. That is where integration management comes in.

- Project scope management. The primary purpose of project scope management is to ensure that all the required work, and only the required work, is performed to complete the project. 

- Project schedule management. The primary purpose of project schedule management is to develop and manage the project schedule so as to complete the project in time as planned. 

- Project resource management. The primary purpose of project resource management is to identify, obtain, and manage the resources needed to complete the project. The term resources resources refers to both human resources and physical resources

- Project cost management. The primary task of project cost management is to estimate and control the project costs, and the primary goal is to complete the project within the approved budget. 

- Project stakeholder management. The primary purpose of project stakeholder management is to identify project stakeholders and manage and monitor their engagement in the project. 

- Project communication management. It is absolutely imperative for the success of the project that project information is generated and distributed, i.e., communicated, in a timely fashion. Some would say communication is the most important aspect of a project and the most important skill for a project manager to have. 

- Project quality management. This process group offers three processes to manage quality: plan quality to determine the quality requirements and standards that are relevant to the project at hand; manage quality to ensure that the planned quality requirements and standards are applied; and control quality to verify that the project and its deliverables meet the quality requirements and conform to the quality standards.

- Project risk management. A project risk is an event that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on meeting the project objectives. The primary purpose of project risk management is to identify risks and respond to them should they occur. 

- Project procurement management. The primary purpose of procurement management is to manage the acquisition of products (that is, products, services, or results) from outside the project team in order to complete the project.

- As you have seen, managing a project largely means performing a set of processes at various stages of the project, such as initiating and planning. Accordingly, processes are grouped corresponding to these stages, and these groups are called process groups. Processes are also part of the knowledge required to manage projects. Each of these processes belongs to one of the ten knowledge areas identified in the PMBOK Guide, Sixth Edition. So, a process has a dual membership—one in a process group, indicating at what stage of the project the process is performed, and the other in a knowledge area,

## Triangular Relationship: Project, Program, and Portfolio

- Program. A program may be defined as a set of interrelated projects all working toward the same set of objectives. These projects are put into a program to reap the benefits of managing them in a coordinated way that would not be available by managing them individually. 

- Portfolio. A portfolio is a higher-level structure that may contain projects, programs, subportfolios, and operations and is managed by a portfolio manager. These components are put together in a portfolio to facilitate effective management in order to implement the strategic business plan of the organization.

- Portfolio management focuses on making sure that programs and projects are prioritized for resources to serve the organization’s strategy. Therefore, investment decisions are usually made at the portfolio level. One task of portfolio management is to select the optimal set of programs and projects to meet the strategic objectives, on one hand, and to increase the likelihood of realizing the desired return on investment, on the other hand. It also provides centralized management of the aggregate risk of all profile components.

- Even if an organization does not have any programs and has only individual projects, all these projects can be grouped into one or more portfolios.

- If an organization has programs and no individual projects external to all programs, all these programs can be grouped into one or more portfolios.

- If an organization has some programs and some individual projects, all these programs and projects can be grouped into one or more portfolios.

- As compared to projects and programs, a portfolio is closer to an organization’s business objectives, and therefore this is where most of the investment decisions are made.

### PROBABILITY-RELATED CONCEPTS

### GLOBAL PROJECT VARIABLES

- Cost and number of team members (staff). This is low in the beginning because the project is just in the preparation stage, reaches a maximum when the project is being executed—that is, when most work is done—and drops rapidly when the project draws to a close because most of the work has already have done.

- Ability to influence the characteristics of the project product. Your or any other stakeholder’s ability to influence the project product characteristics without significantly changing the cost is the highest in the beginning because not much has been done yet in any direction. However, this ability gradually decreases as the project progresses because we have already invested in a given direction.

- Risk and uncertainty. This is highest in the beginning because there are plenty of unknowns and assumptions. It decreases as the project progresses as unknowns start disappearing and details start appearing as a result of the principle of progressive elaboration. This is true about both risk and uncertainty, as risks arise from uncertainty, which at least partially arises from assumptions.

- The project baseline is defined as the approved plan for certain aspects of the project, such as the cost, schedule, and scope of the project. The project performance is measured against this baseline.

## Big Picture of Project Management

- A project, whether standalone or part of a program or a portfolio, is performed to contribute to meeting the strategic objectives of an organization.

- The project lifecycle consists of five stages, technically called process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Depending on the project, these stages may repeat in different phases.

- The project processes that are performed to manage projects make up ten project management knowledge areas: integration management, scope management, time management, cost management, resource management, communication management, stakeholder management, quality management, risk management, and procurement management.

- The big picture of project management: the aspects of a project that need to be managed at different stages of the project lifecycle by using processes


# 2. Project Environment

- Although you use your knowledge in terms of processes to manage projects, the management will be greatly influenced by the environment in which the project runs, such as the structure and culture of the performing organization. Projects also originate from their environments.

- a given project is performed in a certain environment; e.g.; it runs in an organization with its own structure and culture, in a certain location with its own culture and laws. This part of the environment is called the enterprise environment factors (EEF). Now, the organization has some assets, such as knowledge, policy and procedures, and processes, to start the project and support it through its lifecycle. This part of the project environment is called the organizational process assets (OPA).

- Think of influence like a force, and when a force is applied to anything, it has an impact on that thing.

- Enterprise Environment Factors (EEF) . Enterprise environmental factors are factors that are related to the environment either internal or external to the performing organization and that can influence and potentially impact the project. Some examples are the organization’s structure and culture and any city culture conditions external to the organization. The EEF are external to the project.

- Organizational Project Assets (OPA) . These are the processes or process-related assets of the project-performing organization that can be used to help the project succeed. Procedures, templates, and lessons-learned databases developed from previous projects are some examples. The OPA are internal to the organization and external to the project.

- Project Stakeholders . Stakeholders can be both internal and external to the organization and the project. The project team and project sponsor in the organization are examples of internal stakeholders, and customers the external.

## Identifying Environmental Factors and Process Assets and Their Influence on Process

- Identifying the environmental factors is only part of the job, as you must effectively use the positive factors to help the project and try to take action to minimize the effect of negative factors on the project. Note that environmental factors can be internal to the performing organization, such as the organization’s culture, or external to the organization, such as market conditions. However, the organizational process assets are internal only.

## Introducing the Project Stakeholders

### IDENTIFYING PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS

- Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations whose interests are affected (positively or negatively) by the project execution and completion. 

- If we consider, for simplicity, only two cases: a project stakeholder has something to gain from the project or something to lose to the project. Accordingly, these stakeholders fall into two categories—positive stakeholders, who will normally benefit from the success of the project, and negative stakeholders, who will see some kind of disadvantage coming from the project.

- Do not confuse the project management team with the project team. The project management team consists of individuals involved in the project management tasks. It is a subset of the project team, which includes members of the project management team and also other members, such as those who perform the actual work of the project.

### LEADERSHIP SKILLS

- In a traditional organizational structure, such as a functional structure, project managers do not have formal authority over the project team members who perform the team’s work. So, you have no other choice than to manage by leadership and not by authority or power. The good news is that managing by leadership is overall more effective and productive than managing by authority anyway

- Visionary. Visualize the product and how it fits into the big picture of the organization’s strategy, and be able to translate this vision for the team. Have a holistic big-picture view of the project , accounting for all internal and external factors.

### PROJECT BUSINESS CASE

- This document makes the case for the would-be project from a business perspective by providing necessary information that can be used to assess whether the expected project outcome is worth the required investment. It includes the business need, project objectives, and success criterion. 

- In summary, a business case presents and analyzes a problem or an opportunity in the context of the organization’s strategy; proposes alternative courses of action and the criterion of how to select one out of these; based on this criterion, recommend one and state how to measure the benefits and success of the project that would come out of the recommended course of action.

### PROJECT BENEFIT MANAGEMENT PLAN

- The project benefit management plan document describes what, when, and how project benefits would be delivered, as well as how they would be measured. 

- The project manager must keep the general management approach in harmony with the theme of the business case and the project benefit management plan documents, which are interdependent and are developed iteratively and maintained through the project lifecycle.

## Summary

- In an organization, a project is born out of the need to address a problem or an opportunity while staying in alignment with the organization’s strategy. The project is born and performed in a certain environment constituted by three components: enterprise environmental factors (EEF), organizational process assets (OPA), and project stakeholders. EEFs are environmental factors, which can be internal to the organization, such as organizational structure and culture, or external to the organization, such as the law of the land where the organization is located. However, OPAs are only internal to the organization and of two types: processes, policy, and procedures; and knowledge database repositories. The project manager cannot change policy and procedures but can add to the knowledge databases. Enterprise environmental factors are related to how the performing organization does its business, whereas organizational process assets are specific to how the organization runs its projects.

- Project environment influences and hence impacts the project. As a project is being influenced and impacted by its environment, it or its outcome influence and impact back some element of the environment. The goal of project management is to manage the influence of the environment on the project in such a way that the project influences back to change the business-value state of the organization to a higher level.

# 3. Project Integration Management

## Integration Management: Big Picture

- By now, we already know that most of project management is performed through processes. However, project management is not just a collection of processes that you run one after the other and then are done. These processes depend on each other—i.e., they are logically linked to each other by outputs and input—and many of them need to be iterated several times based on the need. This implies that we need to oversee or coordinate the processes that we run to perform the day-to-day project management. The integration management knowledge area offers processes to accomplish just that; in other words, to define, identify, coordinate, and integrate various activities and processes within each project management process group

- It is noteworthy that integration management is the only knowledge area to have processes in every process group; i.e., in all stages of the project lifecycle.

- The project charter is a document that contains the high-level project information, such as the project’s purpose, objectives, and preapproved financial resources. The single most important reason why this document is produced—using the Develop Project Charter process—is to receive the formal authorization for the project. To accomplish this, it is necessary that the charter clearly shows the business need for the project and that the project objectives align with the organization’s strategic objectives. For this purpose,

## Developing the Project Charter

- The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project, and includes naming the project manager, determining the authority level of the project manager, and allowing the project manager to start using organizational resources on the project.

- To summarize, the input items to developing the project charter may include two business documents—project business case and project benefit management plan—enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, and possibly a contract or some other form of agreement. You take the available inputs and apply the relevant tools and techniques to develop the project charter.

### OUTPUT OF DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER

- The output of the Develop Project Charter process contains two items—assumptions log and project charter—

- Assumptions Log . This item contains assumptions and constraints mostly at a strategic and operational level. They are usually recorded in the business case document and can also come from expert judgment. When the project starts, the assumptions log grows as lower-level assumptions are made due to a lack of details that affect cost estimate, schedule, plans, and so on. Assumptions are important as they give rise to risks. An assumption is a factor that you consider to be true without any proof or verification.

- Project Charter. It is a high-level document that summarizes information about the project and its intended outcome. 

- the project charter provides the project manager with the authority to use organizational resources to run the project. Remember that, formally speaking, project charters are prepared external to project management by an individual, a committee in the organization, or the PMO. In other words, project management starts where the project charter ends.

- Once you have the project charter, you know the high-level product requirements that the project will satisfy. However, a high-level requirement written in a certain way might mean different things to different stakeholders. So, after you get the project charter, one of your next tasks will be to develop a common understanding of the project among the project stakeholders. You accomplish this by drawing or explaining boundaries around the project at a lower level—that is, what is included and what is not—thereby spelling out what exactly the deliverables are. By doing this, you are determining the scope of the project at the lower level.

## Developing the Project Management Plan

- So, once the project has been initiated, it is time to do some planning. Project planning starts with the process of Develop Project Management Plan, which defines, prepares, coordinates, and integrates all subsidiary plans, such as scope and risk management plans, into one plan called the project management plan. 

- One necessary item in the plan is the baseline for at least the following project features: scope, time, and cost.

- The project management plan provides the basis of all the needed project work and how it will be performed.

## Directing and Managing Project Work

- The project work defined and scheduled in the project management plan is performed using the Direct and Manage Project Execution process. 

- The three main functions of directing and managing project work are as follows: (1) Execute the planned project activities to produce deliverables in order to meet the project objectives. (2) Produce work performance and related change requests. (3) Implement the approved changes, defect repairs, and other actions.

### INPUT TO DIRECTING AND MANAGING PROJECT WORK

- The project work defined and scheduled in the project management plan is performed using the Direct and Manage Project Execution process.

- In a nutshell, the project management plan and approved change requests are the major inputs to directing and managing project work because executing the project is all about implementing the project management plan along with the approved change requests.

### OUTPUT OF DIRECTING AND MANAGING PROJECT WORK

- Deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and identifiable project outcome (i.e., product, service, or result) identified in the project management plan that must be generated to complete the project. The core purpose of executing the project management plan is to produce deliverables.

- Issue Log . Throughout the project, you will face issues, e.g.; problems, inconsistencies, and conflicts. These issues need to be resolved so they do not start impacting the project negatively. To start the process, you enter an issue into an issue log with the following information: issue type, who raised the issue and when, issue description, priority, who the issue is assigned to, target resolution date, status, and final resolution.

- These change requests might come from inside or outside the performing organization and can be optional or mandated legally or contractually. These change requests must be approved before they can be processed and implemented

- The key benefit of the Direct and Manage Project Work process is that it provides overall management of the project work and the resulting deliverables in an integrated way. This improves the odds of project success.

### MONITORING AND CONTROLLING PROJECT WORK

- The most important overall goal of the Monitor and Control Project Work process is to make sure that the project remains aligned with the organization’s business need from which it originated.

### Input to Monitor and Control Project Work

- The major inputs to this process are the project management plan, to look for any aspect of the project, and work performance data for analysis that comes from directing and managing the project work. We also have project documents, including 1) milestone list with scheduled dates for specific milestones to check if they are being met; 2) project schedule forecasts to determine if the project is within defined schedule tolerance ranges; 3) basis of estimates for information on how the various estimates are made and how they can be used to determine responses to variances; 4) cost forecasts for project’s past performance, used to determine if the project is within the defined budget tolerance ranges and to identify any necessary change requests; 5) issue log shows who is responsible for resolving specific issues by a target date; 6) assumptions log for information on assumptions and constraints identified as affecting the project; 7) change log that contains the status of all change requests; 8) risk register for information on threats and opportunities that could possibly impact project execution; 9) risk report for information on the overall project risks and also on specific individual risks, such as risk sources; 10) quality reports for information on quality management issues, corrective actions, recommendations for project, processes, and product improvements, and summary of findings from the Control Quality process; 11) lessons learned register for information on effective responses for variances, as well as corrective and preventive actions.

### Output for Monitor and Control Project Work

- Original change requests, such as in project scope, product scope, or cost line, if approved, can trigger other changes, such as those to the project management plan, project documents, or product deliverables.

## Performing Integrated Change Control

- The Perform Integrated Change Control process is all about processing change requests, which includes evaluating them; deferring, rejecting, or approving them; and managing the implementation of approved changes and the changes resulting from this implementation.

- Regardless of where they originate, it is the project manager’s responsibility to manage all the changes, which includes getting the changes rejected or approved, ensuring the approved changes get implemented, and changing the affected plans and documents accordingly.

- The Perform Integrated Change Control process is used to manage changes to the project from project initiation through project closure.

- The key benefit of this process is that the changes get documented; they are considered, deferred, rejected, or approved; approved ones are implemented in the entire context of the project; and changes resulting from the implementation are managed. This reduces the risk that would prevail absent this process.

### OUTPUT FROM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL

- Approved Change Requests. You must make sure not only that the approved change requests are implemented through the Direct and Manage Project Work process, but also that the status or info about the deferred and rejected change requests are communicated to the stakeholders who requested the change.

## Managing Project Knowledge

- The Manage Project Knowledge process is used to help meet the project objectives and contribute to organizational knowledge and learning by creating new knowledge and using existing knowledge.

- From the definition of Manage Project Knowledge, it should be clear that managing knowledge is not just about recording or documenting the knowledge to share it, nor is it just about yielding the lessons learned to be used in the future projects.

- In fact, the most important task and challenge of knowledge management is to create an environment where people trust each other and are motivated to learn and share knowledge.

### OUTPUT OF MANAGING PROJECT KNOWLEDGE

- The key benefits of the Manage Project Knowledge process is that new knowledge is created or existing organizational knowledge is improved, and in the process of this creation or improvement the existing knowledge is used. Moreover, the created or improved knowledge is used in the organization’s operations and in future projects or future phases of the current project.

## Performing Project Closure

- Project closure includes ensuring that all the planned work is completed, the planned outcome has been delivered, the project or phase information is archived with the organization, and team resources are released. You also need to determine and coordinate the procedures required for verifying and documenting the project deliverables.

### INPUT TO THE CLOSE PROJECT PROCESS

- It’s important to understand the flow of project deliverables through different processes. They are generated by the Direct and Manage Project Work process, verified through the Quality Control process, accepted by the customer through the Validate Scope process, and transitioned to the appropriate party through the Close Project or Phase process.

## Summary

- The project is initiated, planned, and executed in pieces, and all those pieces are related to each other and need to come together. That is where integration management comes in, which includes developing the project charter, developing the project management plan, directing and managing project work, monitoring and controlling project work, performing integrated change control, managing project knowledge, and closing the project or a phase of the project. You develop the project charter based on two business documents, namely business case and project benefit management plan, hence interfacing the project with the organization’s business need and with the project charter. Then, you develop the project management plan by taking the project charter and output of many other planning processes as input. The project management plan becomes an input to all other integration processes. This virtually means that executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the project are equivalent to implementing the project management plan.

- As a project manager, you manage project execution using the Direct and Manage Project Work process, which will generate change requests that must be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process that in turn sends approved change requests back to the Direct and Manage Project Work process for implementation. The Direct and Manage Project Work process also produces the work performance data that is used by the Monitor and Control Project Work process to generate performance reports and more change requests. These and the change requests directly from stakeholders also must be processed though the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Moreover, directing and managing project work also generates deliverables, which, after verification and validation, become input to the Close Project or Phase process.

- The lessons learned are the output of two processes: Manage Project Knowledge and Close Project or Phase. The lessons are learned throughout the project by performing the Manage Project Knowledge process, and not only at the end of the project or phase.


# 4. Project Scope Management

- you need to collect requirements based on the needs and expectations of the stakeholders and in line with the project objectives. Once you have defined the scope based on these requirements, it needs to be broken down into concrete, manageable tasks that can be assigned and performed. This is accomplished through what is called the work breakdown structure (WBS).

- The primary purpose of project scope management is to ensure that the required work (and only the required work) is performed to complete the project successfully.

## Managing Scope: Big Picture

- The project scope is defined as the work that must be performed to deliver a product with a given scope. The product scope is the set of functions and features that characterize a product to be delivered by the project. 

- The major goal of scope management is to ensure that the required work and only the required work is included and performed in the project.

### DEVELOPING THE PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN

- Before performing the five scope management processes, you must develop the scope management plan, a blueprint that will show how to develop, control, and validate the scope. As mentioned previously, this plan is developed using the Plan Scope Management process

- You must develop this plan in the context of the purpose of the project, which is documented in the project charter, where you will also find a high-level project description and high-level requirements along with other relevant information, such as assumptions and constraints. Also, you will need the project management plan in the input for the quality management plan, details of the project lifecycle, and a development approach. All three will impact how you plan the scope management. Development approach refers to the development approach or approaches adapted for this project, such as agile, waterfalls, or iterative. The plan scope management process will also be influenced by EEFs (Enterprise Environmental Factors) like personnel administration, culture, and infrastructure of the organization, along with marketing conditions. Of course, speaking of OPAs (Organizational Process Assets), this plan will be developed by following the organizational policies and procedures, and you will make use of historical information, including lessons learned from past projects.

### REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN AND SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN

- The requirement management plan basically describes the collect requirements process: how to collect, determine, and document the project and product requirements and plan to manage those requirements.

- Similarly, the scope management plan describes the “how to” details regarding the rest of the scope management processes: define scope, create work breakdown structure, control scope, and validate scope.

- It’s important to realize that product scope and project scope are not independent. Product scope is the set of functions and features that fully define the product, and project scope is the work required to deliver the product. So, the product scope more or less determines the project scope.

## Collecting Requirements for the Project

- A requirement is a condition, characteristic, or capability that a specific outcome of the project must have. 

- How effective you are in capturing requirements will determine how effective you are in getting agreement on these requirements from the stakeholders and in managing the stakeholders’ expectations and needs. Also, these requirements go right into the foundations of the WBS, along with the deliverables. Therefore, collecting requirements effectively is critical for the success of the project.

### TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR COLLECTING REQUIREMENTS

#### Prototyping

- Prototypes can also be used to collect requirements by experimenting with the prototype and letting stakeholders experiment with it and offer feedback. It’s more tangible than the abstract idea of a product. Prototypes can be improved and modified based on the feedback from the stakeholders. In this way, prototypes support the progressive elaboration process of developing requirements.

### OUTPUT OF COLLECTING REQUIREMENTS

#### Requirement Documentation

- This documentation consists of a list of requirements and any necessary details for each item in the list.

- Business Requirements. It describes the business need for which the process was started; e.g.; the overall purpose of the project, such as the opportunity being seized or the business problem being solved.

- Project Requirements. These are about the project-related processes, needs, and conditions, such as milestone data and other conditions in the contract.

- Solution Requirements. These are of two types: 1) functional requirements, referring to the functionality of the project outcome—e.g.; what the product does, its feature; and 2) non-functional requirements, such as compliance, compatibility, support, reliability, safety, and performance.

- Stakeholder Requirements are based on the needs of all or part of the stakeholders.

- Quality Requirements such as not allowing more than three bugs per software module.

- Support and Training Requirements such as the product will be released with a manual.

- Impact of the Requirements. This element describes the impact of requirements on the project and on entities external to the project, such as different groups in the organization.

## Defining the Project Scope

### INPUT TO SCOPE DEFINITION

- The purpose of the Define Scope process is to figure out the detailed descriptions of the project and its product.

### OUTPUT OF SCOPE DEFINITION

- Depending on the input, the scope definition process can generate two kinds of output: the project scope statement, which contains the original scope definition, and approved updates to some project documents. Recall that the project scope statement is a component of the baseline used to manage change requests to the project.

- The project scope statement contains both the project scope and the project product scope.

#### Project Scope Statement

- The key output item of the Define Project process is the project scope statement, which includes the project scope as well as the product scope

- Product Scope Description. Product scope is defined as description of features, functions, and other characteristics a project product.

- Product Acceptance Criteria. This defines the process, criteria, and conditions for accepting the completed products that the project will deliver.

- Project Assumptions and Constraints. Assumptions and constraints are initially included in the project charter. However, at this stage, you have more information about the project and therefore can revisit the initial assumptions and constraints; you might be able to identify more assumptions and constraints. You should document the specific assumptions related to the project scope and also analyze their impact in case they turn out to be false. Due to the uncertainty built into them, assumptions are potential sources of risk.

- Constraints related to the project scope must also be documented in the scope statement. Because constraints limit the team’s options, the constraints’ impact on the project must be evaluated. The constraints can come from various sources, such as a predetermined deadline (also called hard deadline) for the completion of the project or a milestone, limits on the funds available for the project, and contractual provisions.

- Project Deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and verifiable project outcome, such as a product, a capability to provide a service, or a result. It may be required to be produced to complete a project, a process, or a phase of the project. The deliverables may also include related material, such as manuals and other documentation. The scope statement provides the list of deliverables and their descriptions.

- Project Exclusions. This involves drawing boundaries around the project by specifying what is included and what is not, especially focusing on the gray areas where stakeholders may make their own assumptions, different from each other’s. It generally identifies what is excluded from the project, which helps to manage stakeholder expectations.

- You must be able to make a distinction between objectives, deliverables, and requirements. For example, in a project to launch a website, the site is a deliverable. That the site must print a warning message at the login time is a requirement, and that the site should increase the company revenue by 3 percent is an objective.

- It serves as a component of the baseline that will be used to evaluate whether a request for a change or additional work falls within or beyond the scope of the project; hence, helps with avoiding scope creep.

- In general, it helps with making project decisions throughout the lifecycle of the project.

- By providing a common understanding of the project scope, the scope statement helps bring the stakeholders onto the same page in their expectations.

- Because the scope statement describes the deliverables and the work required to create those deliverables, it is used to create a WBS, which helps in scheduling the project.

- It serves as a guide for the project team to do more-detailed planning.

- From the perspective of actually performing the work, the scope statement is still a high-level document. To be able to schedule the project, identify and assign resources, and manage the project successfully, these deliverables need to be broken down into manageable tasks. This is accomplished by creating an entity called the work breakdown structure (WBS).

## Creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- a WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy of the work that must be performed to accomplish the objectives of and create the deliverables for the project.

### DECOMPOSITION

- Decomposition is a technique for subdividing the project deliverables into smaller, manageable tasks called work packages. 

- 1.Identify the deliverables and the work involved by analyzing the project scope statement and requirement documentation. 
- 2.Understand the relationships among the deliverables. 
- 3.Structure and organize the first level (just below the root of the hierarchical tree) of the WBS hierarchy. Based on the project at hand, you can use one of the following approaches; e.g.; use the deliverables as the components in the first level or use the phases of the project as the components in the first level. 
- 4.Decompose the upper level into more-detailed components for the lower level. 
- 5.Keep decomposing to lower levels until necessary and sufficient decomposition has been achieved. 
- 6.Assign identification codes to the WBS components.

- excessive decomposition leads to inefficient use of management and other resources. Necessary and sufficient decomposition is the key.

- While using the technique of decomposition, remember a useful concept or trick: rolling wave planning. It’s a fancy term that refers to handling a deliverable or its subcomponent that cannot be decomposed further currently because we don’t know the details about it yet; (...) We leave the decomposition of such a deliverable at a level allowed by the available information and wait on further decomposition until more information becomes available. 

### OUTPUT OF CREATING WBS

#### SCOPE BASELINE

- Project Scope Statement. This document includes project and product scope description, project deliverables, product acceptance criteria, and project assumptions and constraints.

- Work Breakdown Structure. As explained earlier, the WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical structure that decomposes the project scope and deliverables into the work packages that will be executed by the project team to create the planned deliverables and in this way accomplish the planned project objectives. The project manager creates this document with the help of the project team.

- Work Packages and Control Account. Remember, at the lowest part of each branch in WBS we have work packages, each of which is assigned a unique identifier. To this identifier is attached information about schedule, resources, and cost for this work package, and it acts as a code of account. In other words, each work package represents a deliverable or a component of it, with schedule, resources, and cost attached. Using one or more such points or codes of account, information on schedule, resources, and cost for a group of work packages can be summed or integrated and managed. This way, each package control point becomes a part of what is called the control account for that group of work packages. A control account represents a control management point where scope, schedule, and cost are integrated for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the performance; e.g.; comparing with earned value.

- A control account may contain one or more work packages, but a work package can have membership in only one control account. This means that a control account is in some package above the work packages and contains all the work packages below it in the branch to which it belongs.

- the end goal of the WBS is to specify the project scope in terms of work packages; this is what distinguishes the WBS from other information breakdown structures.

- The approved version of the scope baseline becomes a component of the project management plan and can be changed only through the formal change control procedure, i.e., running the processes. It plays a crucial role in determining many aspects of the project, such as schedule, cost, quality, and procurement.

## Controlling Scope

- Controlling the project scope is all about keeping a tab on the status of the project scope and product scope as well as managing changes to the scope baseline.

- Watch out for scope creep. Determine whether it has happened and correct the situation. Scope creep refers to scope changes applied without processing them though the change control process.

- Process the scope change requests through the integrated change control process for approval.

- Manage the implementation of scope changes after approval, as well as their impact across the project.

## Validating the Scope of Project Deliverables

- Validating scope is the process of formally accepting the completed project deliverables, which have already been verified for their correctness by using the control quality process. Before you hand over the project deliverables to the appropriate party mentioned in the project management plan, such as the customer or the sponsor, you need to validate with the party that the deliverables actually meet the planned scope.

- Do not confuse scope validation with quality control or scope verification performed using quality control, which is primarily focused on checking the correctness of the deliverables and other quality requirements; scope validation is about ensuring that the entire scope with the requirements with have implicated.


# 5. Project Schedule Management

- the overall project work—i.e., the project scope—is broken down into smaller, more manageable components. These components in the WBS are called work packages. However, a work package might not be a suitable item to assign to an individual to perform. So, work packages can be rearranged or decomposed into smaller components called activities . A project schedule contains not only the activities to be performed, but also the order, or sequence, in which the activities will be performed and the start and finish dates. The sequencing of activities is constrained by the dependencies among the activities. A realistic project schedule can be created from the bottom up by identifying the activities, estimating the resources needed for the activities, and determining the time that each activity will take with the given resources available. The schedule, once developed and approved, needs to be controlled to stay on track. All these tasks belong to what is called project schedule management.

## Project Schedule Management : Big Picture

- Developing and controlling the project schedule so as to complete the project work in time is what schedule management all about.

- To complete a project, you need to perform some activities to produce the project deliverables. To make that happen, you need to estimate resources for the activities and schedule the activities. But before all this can happen, you need to identify the activities. One thing more: all this should happen as planned.

- Activity. A component of project work.

- Activity Duration. The time measured in calendar units between the start and finish of a schedule activity.

- Schedule Activity. A scheduled task (component of work) performed during the lifecycle of a project.

- Logical Relationship. A dependency between two project schedule activities or between a schedule activity and a schedule milestone.

- Schedule Milestone. A milestone is a significant point (or event) in the life of a project, and a schedule milestone is a milestone on the project schedule. A milestone refers to the completion of an activity, marking possibly the completion of a set of activities, and therefore has zero duration. The completion of a major deliverable is an example of a milestone.

- Plan Schedule Management. Plans how to develop, execute, and control the project schedule.

- Define Activities. Identifies the specific schedule activities, or pieces of work, that must be performed to produce the project deliverables.

- Sequence Activities. Puts the activities to be scheduled in a sequence by identifying the dependencies among them.

- Estimate Activity Duration. Estimates the time in units of work periods required for each schedule activity’s completion. A work period is a measurement of time when the work is in progress; it is measured in hours, days, or months, depending upon the size of the activity. This estimate is performed for given resources.

- Develop Schedule. Develops the project schedule by analyzing schedule activity sequences, schedule activity durations, resource requirements, and schedule constraints.

- Control Schedule. Monitors the status of the project’s progress to manage the resulting changes in project schedule and hence in the schedule baseline.

- The underlying philosophy of project management for schedule development is to first develop the schedule based on the work required to complete the project tasks, and then see how you can make it conform to other constraints, calendar requirements, and strategic goals of the organization. 

## Planning Schedule Management

- the Plan Schedule Management process is about planning how to develop, execute, and control the project schedule. 

## Schedule Management Plan

- The schedule management plan document records how to develop, execute, and control the project schedule.

- The time-boxed periods are used in projects with adaptive lifecycles. They help you avoid scope creep by making the team focus on essential works within the scope.

## Defining Activities

- Activities are pieces of work that need to be performed to produce the project deliverables. However, first we need to identify them, and we do that using the Define Activities process

- This process identifies activities, or pieces of work, that will need to be completed in order to deliver the project outcome. In the previous chapter, we covered WBS all the way up to work packages; that is where identifying project activities starts. So, the starting point for defining activities is the lowest level of the WBS that contains work packages. Basically, each work package is broken down into one or more activities.

- Project Scope Baseline. The following three components of the project scope baseline are needed to define activities:
WBS and WBS dictionary. The work packages in the WBS are decomposed into project activities. To define activities in detail so that you can assign appropriate resources to them, you need details about the work packages, which are provided in the WBS dictionary.

- Project Scope Statement. The WBS is built from the project scope statement. While dealing with the WBS, you might need to go back to the project scope statement. The following elements of the project scope statement are especially important to consider while identifying activities:
Assumptions related to the activities or schedule planning, such as work hours per week

- Constraints that will limit the schedule options, such as predetermined deadlines on project milestones

- Project deliverables, to ensure everything is covered in the WBS work packages

### GENERATING THE OUTPUT OF DEFINING ACTIVITIES

- The key output item of the activity definition process is a comprehensive list of all the activities that need to be performed to produce the project deliverables.

- The Define Activities process generates the final output as activities and not deliverables. Therefore, ideally speaking, the WBS and the WBS dictionary should be generated before defining activities. However, practically speaking, the activity list, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary can be developed concurrently.

- Deliverables are broken down into work packages, which are subsequently broken down into activities in a rolling wave or progressive elaboration fashion. This may create the need to modify the baseline, which may affect the cost baseline. But, to make a change to any baseline, you must create a change request, which would be processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process. If the change is approved and implemented, the scope baseline and cost baseline documents may need to be updated accordingly.

- Before you can schedule them, the identified activities need to be arranged in the correct order, which is called sequencing .

## Sequencing Activities

- The activity sequencing process is used to arrange the schedule activities in the appropriate order, which takes into account the dependencies among the activities

- One main advantage of sequencing activities is that it is a way to handle project constraints in the most efficient manner.

### TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR GENERATING PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMS

#### Determining and Integrating Dependencies

- Logical relationships can be displayed in schematic diagrams, called project schedule network diagrams , or just network diagrams for brevity. A common method used to develop network diagrams is called the precedence diagramming method (PDM) .

#### Precedence Diagramming Method ( PDM )

- Finish to Start. The initiation of the successor activity depends upon the completion of the predecessor activity—that is, the successor activity cannot be started until the predecessor activity has already been completed.

- Finish to Finish. The completion of the successor activity depends upon the completion of the predecessor activity—that is, the successor activity cannot be completed until the predecessor activity has already been completed.

- Start to Start. The initiation of the successor activity depends upon the initiation of the predecessor activity—that is, the successor activity cannot be initiated until the predecessor activity has already been initiated.

- Start to Finish. The completion of the successor activity depends upon the initiation of the predecessor activity—that is, the successor activity cannot be completed until the predecessor activity has already been initiated.

-  In general, PDM supports all four kinds of precedence relationships discussed earlier, but the most commonly used dependency relationship in PDM is finish-to-start. The start-to-finish relationship is rarely used.

- Applying Leads and Lags: Applying a lead means you allow the successor activity to start before the predecessor activity finishes, and applying a lag means you start the successor activity a few days after the predecessor activity finishes. Sometimes, you might need to make such adjustments in the schedule for effectiveness and efficiency. Of course, leads and lags are measured in units of time, such as days.

- Once the activities have been identified and the resources required to perform them have been gathered, as shown in the next chapter, you have enough information to begin estimating the time needed to complete each activity, which is called the activity duration.

## Estimating Activity Duration

- Activity duration is the time between the start and finish of an activity. Activity duration is estimated in work periods by using the Estimate Activity Durations process for the given resources assigned to the activity. A work period is a measurement of time when the work is in progress; it is measured in hours, days, or months, depending upon the size of the activity. This estimate can be converted to calendar units of time by factoring in the resource’s passive time, such as holidays.

### ACTIVITY AND RESOURCES INFORMATION FOR DURATION ESTIMATION

- Some assumptions and constraints in the project scope statement, another component of the scope baseline, can affect activity duration estimates as well.

- Sometimes assigning additional resources might reduce the overall efficiency and productivity. For example, think of two engineers with different skill levels assigned to work on interrelated components of an activity.

- Most of the activities have a threshold beyond which assigning additional resources does not help. For example,

- Resource Breakdown Structure, Resource Calendar, and Team Assignments . Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS ) is a hierarchical structure that displays the identified resources by category and type. The resource calendar, finalized (or modified) during the activity resource estimating, contains the type, quantity, availability, and capability of each resource, including the skills of a human resource, which must be considered during activity duration estimating. 

- Also, capability and quantity of available resources, both human and material, can affect the activity duration estimate. For example, if an activity will take four work days for an engineer to finish, and the engineer can work only four hours a day on this activity, it will take eight calendar days to finish.

### TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR ACTIVITY DURATION ESTIMATING

- The project schedule depends upon the activity duration estimates. The duration estimates of activities on the critical path will determine the finish date of a project for a given start date. However, there might be many uncertainties involved in the estimate. For example, two programmers, due to the differences in their experience, will take different amounts of time to write the same program.

- Analogous Estimating. Analogous estimating techniques estimate the duration of an activity based on the duration of a similar activity in a previous project. The accuracy of the estimate depends upon how similar the activities are and whether the team member who will perform the activity has the same level of expertise and experience as the team member from the previous project. 

- Three-point Estimating. This method addresses the issue of uncertainty in estimating the activity duration. The spread of these three estimates determines the uncertainty. The resultant duration is calculated by taking the average of the three estimates. (Most-likely Scenario, Optimistic Scenario, Pessimistic Scenario)

- In general, the duration value is obtained by adding the three values and dividing by three. However, the most-likely scenario may be given more weight than the other two scenarios.

- Bottom-up Technique . This technique is used when it’s difficult to estimate the duration of an activity; for example, it’s big in size or complicated. This technique decomposes the activity into smaller pieces, estimates the durations of those pieces, and aggregates all those duration values into one final value.

- By using the various processes discussed in this chapter, you have identified activities, arranged them in proper sequence, determined resource requirements for them as discussed in next chapter, and estimated their durations. All these tasks and accomplishments are a means to an end called project schedule development.

## Developing the Project Schedule

### COLLECTING INFORMATION FOR SCHEDULE DEVELOPMENT

- Global Information. The WBS and WBS dictionary will provide detail about the project deliverables, which are the real reason for the schedule. The schedule development plan will show “how” and what type of information—e.g.; what method and tools—should be used to create the schedule. Don’t lose sight of this big picture while figuring out the schedule details.

- Activity Relationship–Related Information. The information about dependencies among the activities and in which order they should be performed can be extracted from: 1) Schedule network diagrams; 2) milestones list with hardcoded, i.e., fixed, dates; and 3) resource calendars showing the availability of resources along the timeline.

- Risk-Related Information. This can be extracted from scheduled assumptions in the assumptions log, which may lead to risk, and schedule-related risks in the risk register. This information will help with risk mitigation by applying the contingency reserve, explained earlier in the chapter, in the project schedule.

### APPLYING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR SCHEDULE DEVELOPMENT

- Starting with network diagrams and activity duration, you move to put the information pieces together while dealing with issues like the following: (1) The actual start date (2) Uncertainty on the availability of resources (3) Identification of and preparation for activities on the critical path (4) Risks involved, or “what if” scenarios (5) The hard start/finish dates for activities or for the project that came down the pipeline from very important stakeholders

#### Critical Path Method

- The critical path is the longest path (sequence of activities) in a project schedule network diagram. Because it is the longest path, it determines the duration of the project, and hence the finish date of the project given the start date. 

- The second important step of the critical path method is to identify the flexibility in the project schedule by calculating the early and late start and finish dates of each activity on each path. The schedule flexibility of an activity is measured by the positive difference between the late start date and the early start date for the activity; this is called float time or total float.

- Each activity on a critical path has zero float time, and therefore poses a schedule risk. Therefore, you must monitor the activities on all critical paths very closely during the execution of the project.

#### Resource Optimization

- Resource optimization refers to optimizing the use of available resources to finish the project within the planned start and finish dates.

- Resource Leveling. Resource leveling is applied to the schedule that has already been analyzed using other methods, such as the critical path method, and hence we know the project start and finish dates, as well as start and finish dates and floats for activities. This techniques adjusts the start and finish dates of activities, using the already assigned resources to finish the project within the planned start and finish dates. 

- Due to the change in the activity durations, resource leveling can result in a change of critical paths. Resource smoothing may not always optimize the use of resources.

#### Simulations and “What if” Scenario Analysis

- “What if” Scenario Analysis. The purpose of “what if” scenario analysis is to calculate the effects of a specific scenario on the schedule (...) Because a “what if” scenario by definition represents uncertainty, this analysis often leads to risk planning, which might include changing the schedule or changing the network diagram to get a few activities out of harm’s way if possible.

- As you have seen, the critical path method is used to develop a schedule for given resources, whereas a method called the critical method that method factors in the uncertainty of the availability of the resources. The resource leveling technique is used to move the resources around to meet the resource needs of the activities that must be accomplished by a specific date. In other words, in an ideal world in which the required (or planned) resources are guaranteed, you do not need the critical chain method and resource leveling; just the critical path method will do.

- Let’s assume you have used the critical path method to determine the schedule for a project. You have also applied other techniques, such as the critical chain method and resource leveling. The final realistic schedule that you have come up with has an unacceptable project duration (the length of the critical path). What do you do? This is where the schedule compression technique comes to your rescue.

#### Schedule Compression

- Schedule compression is an attempt to shorten the project schedule without changing the project scope. It may be necessary in order to deal with schedule-related constraints and objectives. It is true that you, the project manager, build the schedule through cold, hard mathematical analysis and you don’t just accept whatever schedule goals come down the pipeline from elsewhere, such as from the customer or the project sponsor. However, once you have the schedule built through analysis, you can attempt to accommodate some critical stakeholder expectations or hard deadlines, such as a predetermined project finish date. I have already discussed one such method, called resource leveling, to accommodate hard deadlines for activities. In this section, I will discuss two more methods for schedule compression: crashing and fast tracking.

- Crashing . This is a schedule compression technique in which cost and schedule tradeoffs are analyzed to decrease the project duration with minimal additional cost. A number of alternatives are analyzed, including the assignment of additional resources. Approving overtime is another example of crashing. This option may increase the cost.

- Fast Tracking . This is a schedule compression technique used to decrease the project duration by performing project phases or some schedule activities within a phase in parallel that would normally be performed in sequence. For example, testing of a product can start when some of its components are finished, rather than waiting for the whole product to be completed.

- Crashing usually involves assigning more resources, hence increasing the cost. However, guard yourself against the misconception that additional resources will linearly improve the performance. 

### OUTPUT OF THE SCHEDULE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

- Project Schedule . The project schedule includes a planned start date and a planned finish date for each schedule activity. The schedule will be considered preliminary until the resources have been assigned to perform the activities according to the schedule.

- Schedule Baseline . This is a specific version of the project schedule that is accepted and approved by the appropriate stakeholder, such as the project sponsor. This schedule baseline becomes part of the project plan. The actual project work results are compared against this baseline to measure the project’s progress. Any proposed change to this baseline must go through standard change procedures—the Integrated Change Control process.

- Project schedule development is an iterative process. For example, it might be necessary to review and revise the duration and resource estimates for some activities to create a project schedule that will be approved. The approved project schedule will act as a baseline against which project progress will be tracked.

## Controlling Schedule

- Schedule control has a three-pronged goal: 1) monitor the status of the project to see if it’s progressing according to the planned schedule, and if it’s not, 2) take action, such as changing resources or changing schedule; and 3) manage this change. As a project manager, you should be out in front of the project, performing the following tasks on regular basis:

- Determine the current status of the project schedule.
- Influence the factors that generate schedule changes.
- Determine whether the project schedule has changed—for example, if some activities are running late.
- Manage the changes as they occur.
- Detect or measure a schedule change by comparing the project execution results—i.e., work performance data—against the schedule baseline;

### PERFORMING THE CONTROL SCHEDULE PROCESS

#### Generating the Work Performance Information: Measuring Variance

- Earned Value Analysis. These techniques are used to calculate the schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) and are discussed in detail in terms of cost in an upcoming chapter on cost management. In this process, you use these quantities to assess the variation from the schedule baseline.

- Variance Analysis. Performing a barebones schedule variance analysis, this technique is crucial to schedule monitoring because it reveals the deviation of the actual start and finish dates from the planned start and finish dates of schedule activities. It also reveals the variations of actual versus planned durations and floats. It might suggest corrective actions to be taken to keep the project on track.

- Performance Reviews. Performance reviews are simple reviews of project progress that compare the performance data with the schedule baseline. These comparisons use start and end dates and percentages of completed and remaining work to analyze the variances.

#### Generating Schedule Forecast

- Schedule forecasts are predictions of the future state of the project if it continues on the current path defined by the current schedule-related work performance information. Forecasts are based on trends extracted from current and past information. The variance analysis technique and PMIS also include the ability to forecast the effect of variances on the project’s future. You can also use trend analysis techniques that compare the work performance data with the schedule baseline over time. One such technique in called an iteration burndown chart.

- After we find out that the project has gone off track by measuring the deviation in terms of variance, the question is how to get the project back on track—in alignment with the schedule baseline.

#### Bringing Project Back on Track: Generating Change Requests and Updates

- Having measured the schedule variations from the schedule baseline, there are only two ways to put the project back on track: 1) align the project with the schedule baseline without updating the baseline; and 2) update the baseline.

- Align the Project with Schedule Baseline Without Updating the Baseline. This can be done by using techniques already discussed while covering the schedule development process. The examples include resource optimization, schedule compression, lag and leads, and what-if scenario analysis.

- Update the Schedule Baseline. A schedule baseline update is an obvious way to align the project schedule with the schedule baseline. You can use trend lines and future forecasts as a guide to updating the baseline. Before the schedule baseline updates can be applied, change requests will need to be created, which must go through the standard approval process. Schedule change request will also trigger other change requests, such as those to the cost baseline. Work performance information produced in this process may also create non–schedule related change requests as well.

- Since schedule variance on the critical or near critical path directly impacts the project finish date, mainly these paths determine the project status. Therefore, the activities on these paths should be closely watched; even a short delay for the critical path may produce a bigger effect on the project end date than bigger delays on non-critical paths.

- Remember that corrective actions are not about going back and fixing past mistakes. Rather, they’re about ensuring that future results match with the plan. You can do this by influencing the future results, such as by expediting the execution or by changing the plan.

- Various schedule management processes are used to produce schedule data—a list of schedule activities and attributes for each activity, such as activity duration, previous and following activity, and also the required resources, determined by a resource management process.

- The schedule data is used to develop the project schedule, which is an iterative process due to the uncertainties in the schedule data and due to the changes made during project execution. Nevertheless, the approved version of the planned schedule is used as a baseline to track the project progress.

- The schedule needs to be controlled to keep the project on the track—i.e., in alignment with the schedule baseline. The major output items of the schedule control process are work performance information, schedule forecasts, and change requests resulting from comparing the schedule-related work performance data with the schedule baseline.

## Summary

- Project schedule development is a journey that begins with decomposing the work packages in the WBS into project activities and ends with an approved schedule for performing those activities, called the schedule baseline. The schedule, once developed, needs to be controlled to keep the actual project execution in sync with this baseline. 

- All the pieces developed by these processes come together to develop the project schedule by using the Develop Schedule process via a host of techniques. You, for example, may start with using the critical path method to develop the project schedule from a network diagram. After you have this schedule, you can use schedule compression methods, such as fast tracking and crashing, to accommodate hard deadlines. Schedule development is an iterative process that can continue throughout the project execution due to approved changes and risk occurrences. However, the approved planned project schedule is used as a baseline to track the project’s progress. You need to control the schedule to keep it aligned with the schedule baseline, which includes monitoring the status of the project’s progress and controlling the changes to the schedule baseline.

# 6. Project Resource Management

- Executing a project requires resources, and executing a project successfully requires the optimal use of those resources. Therefore, coordinating and managing resources, including both human resources—also called team resources—and physical resources—i.e., material, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure—is an integral part of overall project execution. Identifying, acquiring, and managing these resources is called resource management .

- Therefore, for the team to be successful, it has to be effective in both dimensions: its members must be competent in performing their individual assignments, and the interaction among them must be constructive overall. 

## Resource Management: Big Picture

- the Estimate Activity Resources process, a resource management process, generates activity resource requirements, which are an input to the Develop the Project Schedule process, which in turn is used to estimate cost. The cost estimate is an input back to the Estimate Activity Resources process, and also an input to Determine Budget, which generates the cost baseline that is an input to Acquiring Resources. Note here the close connection between resource management and cost management.

- Plan Resource Management. This process is used to develop the resource management plan, which identifies the project roles, assigns responsibilities to these roles, and provides guides to how to perform the rest of the resource management processes.

- Estimate Activity Resources. Estimates the types and amounts of team and physical resources that will be required to perform each schedule activity. Physical resources are non-human resources such as facilities, equipment, material, and supplies.

- Acquire Project Team. The process of obtaining the team and physical resources estimated by the preceding process.

- Develop Team. The process of developing an optimal team by improving the individual competencies and interactions among the individual team members, thereby improving the team environment.

- Manage Project Team. The process of optimizing the team—hence, project performance—by tracking the performance of and providing feedback to the individual team members, managing changes related to the team, and resolving issues.

- Control Resources. The process of keeping planned, assigned (i.e., allotted), and used physical resources synchronized by ensuring that they are allotted, used, and released immediately after use.

- resource management and cost management are closely connected. Also, the project team is a subset of the project stakeholders, so there is obviously an overlap between resource management and stakeholder management.

## Developing the Resource Plan

- The main goal of the Plan Resource Management process is to develop a document that will answer the question: How do you identify the right resources in just the right amount and manage them for the successful completion the project?

### TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR RESOURCE PLANNING

- At the heart of resource planning lies the art of converting the information about work packages or related activities and activity resource requirements into roles and responsibilities. For example, consider an activity in a project—writing a software program. The program will be written by a programmer, which is a human resource, in this case a team resource. However, before you even know the name of the programmer, for planning purposes you can work with this programmer as a role whose main responsibility is to write the program, later assigning a real individual to fill this role. This approach allows for planning before hiring.

- Protocol : a defined set of standards that computers must follow in order to communicate properly.
- Computer networking : the name we've given to the full scope of how computers communicate with each other.

- (1) Physical layer : represents the physical devices that interconnect computers.
- (2) Data link layer : responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate.
- The Ethernet standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.
- (3) Network layer : allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.
- internetwork : a collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the Internet.
- IP is the heart of the Internet and most smaller networks around the world.
- (4) Transport layer: sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data.
- (5) Application layer 


- Cables : connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them.
- Hub : A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once.
- Collision domain: A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time. If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other.
- Switch : A switch is very similar to a hub, since you can connect many devices to it so they can communicate. The difference is that while a hub is a layer 1 or physical layer device, a switch is a level 2 or data link device. This means that a switch can actually inspect the contents of the Ethernet protocol data being sent around the network, determine which system the data is intended for and then only send that data to that one system.
- Hubs and switches : The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN, or local area network.
- Router : Network layer, A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks.
- Border gateway protocal(BGP) : Routers share data with each other via this protocal, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic.

- Modulation : A way of varing the voltage of this charge moving across the cable.
- Duplex communication : The concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable.
- Simplex communication: This process is unidirectional.f

- CSMA/CD : used to determine when the communications channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data.
- MAC address : A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface. It's a 48-bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers.
- Ethernet uses MAC address to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, as well as the one the transmission was intended for.

- A unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.
- If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, it means that ethernet frame is intended for only the destination address.
- if the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means you're dealing with a multicast frame.

- Data packet : An all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link.
- Ethernet frame : A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order.
- Virtual LAN (VLAN) : A technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs operating on the same physical equipment.
- Ethernet itself only reports on data integrity, It doesn't perform data recovery.
- IP addresses belong to networks, not to the devices attached to those networks.
- In most cases, static IP addresses are reserved for servers and network devices, while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients.

- IP datagram : A highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined.

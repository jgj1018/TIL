#### Technical Support Fundamentals.

- Information technology (IT) : The use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information.

- Computer : A device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.

- Algorithm : A series of steps that solve specific problems.

- Banary system : The communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numeral system.

- A group of 8 bits is referred to as a byte.

- Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system(2^8)

- Character encoding : Assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them.

- Logic gates: Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.

- Abstraction : To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.


##### Four layers.

- Hardware layer : Made up of the physical components of a computer.

- Operating system : Allows hardware to communicate with the system.

- Software layter : How we as humans interact with our computer

- User : Interacts with the computer


#### Hardwares

- Ports: Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.

- CPU(Central processing unit) : The brain of our computer, it does all the calculations and data processing.

- RAM(Random access memory): our computer's short-term memory.

- Hard drive : Holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications.

- Motherboard : The body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.

- Power supply : convert electricity from our wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use.

- Programs: Instructions that tell the computer what to do

- MCC: a bridge between the CPU and the RAM, a nerve in your brain connecting to your memories.

- There are 3 different cache levels in a CPU: L1, L2 and L3. L1 is the smallest and fastest cache.

- Clock speed : The maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period.


##### CPU

- When you select your CPU, you'll need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard - the circute board that connects all your components together.

##### RAM

- There are lots of types of RAM, and the one that's commonly found in computeres is DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory.
- There are also different types of memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on. The more modern DIMM sticks, which usually stands for Dual Inline Memory Module, have different sizes of pins on them.
- In today's system, we use another type of RAM, called double data rate SDRAM or DDR SDRAM for short.

##### Motherboard

- Peripherals : External devices we connect to our computer, like a mouse, keyboard, and monitor.
- Expansion slots : give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer.

##### Storage

##### Power supply

- As a general rule, be sure to use the proper voltage for your electronics.
- Wattage : The amount of volts and amps that a device needs. 

##### Peripherals

- Anything that you connect to your computer externally that adds functionality.
- MB is megabyte or unit of data storage, while Mb/s is a megabit per second, which is a unit of data transfer rate.
- Remember that 1 byte is 8 bits, so to transfer a 1MB file in a second, you need an 8 Mb/s connection speed.


- Standoffs are used to raise and attach your motherboard to the case.


### Operating system

- Operating system : The whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets us interact with it.
- Our kernal optimizes memory usage and makes sure our applciations have enough memory to run.
- I/O management: Anything that can give us input, or that we can use for output of data.
- We write data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks.
- Block storage : Improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.
- File extension : The appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems. 
- Process : A program that's executing, like our internet browser or text editor.
- Program : An application that we can run, like Chrome.
- Time slice : A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU exection.
- Kernal : creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated.
- virtual memory : the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.
- I/O devices : Devices that perform input and output.
- When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine, it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency.
- BIOS/UEFI : A low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to makesure everything is good to go.
- Bootloader : A small program that loads the operating system.

### Network

- The Internet : The physical connection of computers and wires around the world.
- The Web : The information on the internet. The world wide web isn't the only way we can access to Internet.
- When you send or receive data through a network you need to have both an IP and a MAC address.
- Router : Connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.
- Network stack : A set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer.
- Network Address Translation (NAT) : Lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network.

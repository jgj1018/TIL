- The role and day-to-day responsibilities of products management vary enormously from organization to organization. But these are the general characteristics of product management roles.
- You are the connector and aligner between people who build things. (such as developers and designers) but you're not actually the person building things.
- You have lots of responsibility, but very little authority.

Project management

- As a product manager, you can expect to spend a lot of time taking with people.
- Your title won't tell you exactly what to do. And "that's not my job" is usually the last thing a working product manager says.
- Bad product managers are pretty consistent.
    - Jargon jockey
    - The Steve Jobs Acolyte
    - The Hero Product Manager
    - The Product Martyr
    - The Nostalgic engineer

    → These archetypes all have something in common: They are defensively trying to prove their value.

- Great Product Managers can be anyone.
- Great Product Managers are people who have learned how to
    - make connections
    - challenge assumptions
    - be curious about new things.

- The skills required to connect and align between developers and designers are very different from the skills required to be a developer or a designer. These are connective skills, not "hard skills" or "soft skills"

- new skill model for product managers : CORE (communication, organization, research, execution)
- communication: Clarity over comfort.
- Good product managers err on the side of clarity vs. explaining the obvious. Bad product managers never explain the obvious.
- Communication means reaching out to people before you need something from them.

- Organization: Change the rules, don't break the rules.
- Research: Live in your user's reality
- research is just another name for critical thinking
- if you are making decisions based on entirely on internal politics, then you are not living in your customer's reality. This doesn't mean you can insulate your team from organizational politics. It means you need to use insights about your customer to resolve politic disagreements.
- Execution: No work above, no work beneath.
- Best practices are useful. Just don't believe the hype.
- The best thing about "best practices": Because so many "best practices" have the halo of a well-respected organization around them, it's often easier to get people to at least try them.
- The product manager might manage and influence the roadmap.
- 1 step to managing roadmaps: make sure everybody in your organization understands and agree about how roadmaps are being used.
- As a rule, the prioritization process will be as clear and straightforward as the goals you are using to prioritize.
- goals need to be clearly stated, finite, actionable, and systematized.
- Objectives and key results (OKRs)
- Part of your job as a product manager is to push relentlessly for clarity around goals.
- If your team is working well together, and is aligned around both the needs of your customer and the goals of your business, then you are succeeding.

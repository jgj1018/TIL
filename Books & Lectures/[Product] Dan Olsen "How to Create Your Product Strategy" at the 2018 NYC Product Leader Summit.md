- product manager's motto: with great responsibility comes no power.

- Why do so few companies have a good product strategy?
  - Two main reasons:
    - Focus on the short-term
    - Lack of a good framework
    
- What is strategy?
  - Your plan for how you are going to win?
  - Informed by competitive analysis
  - Looking at long-term vs short-term
  - Big picture: large rocks vs sand
    - The sand is all those little things that come up, the meeting, the email, the bug, the customer requests. The big rocks are the big strategic things are important and this
    - Unless you make room for the big rocks, the sand will overwhelm everything.
  - Saying NO
  
- People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. but that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. 

- The product-market fit pyramid
  - UX
  - Feature set
  - Value proposition (product strategy lives here)
  - (product-market fit: all the decisions and assumptions and execution we are doing in the top 3 layers, how well did they resomate with the market)
  - Underserved needs
  - Target Customer
  
  
- Problem space: A customer problem, need or benefit that the product should address
- Solution space: A specific design or implementation to address the problem or need
- Benefits not features. (features -> 5whys -> benefits)

- Kano model: user needs & satisfaction (search)

- Product Strategy grid 
  - step1: list customer benefits, one per row (delighter benefit, performance benefit, must have benefit)
  - Step2: add competitors, one per column
  - step3: Rate your competitors
  - step4: define your product strategy
    - which user benefits are you providing?
    - How are you better than competitors?


- Summary
  - Think about long-term and big rocks
  - Determine target market: segmentation
  - Think in terms of benefits not features
  - Use Kano model to:
    - Analyze your competitors
    - Define your product strategy
  - Clarify your unique differentiators

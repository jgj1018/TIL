- This(UX) is a touchpoint of the Double Diamond process. We discover, we define, we develop and we deliver.

- The first role is the User Researcher. A User Researcher identifies user needs and user behaviors. This can be relating or researching what human beings do. This could involve things like interviews, surveys quantitative data. To the right is an example of a persona.

- The second role is a Business Analyst. A Business Analyst identifies business needs and structure. Some of their tasks could include stakeholder interviews surveys of the business, requirements gathering, which is incredibly important and that could be involved through exercises like card sorting, by relating technology usage and most importantly is establishing an understanding what are KPIs.

- The third role is an Information Architect. An Information Architect identifies systems and technology structure. A lot of times their task involves things like sitemaps, which is something that you see to the right. 

- The fourth role is an Interaction Designer. An Interaction Designer identifies user needs interactions and behaviors and builds how users interact with an interface

- The fifth role is a User Interface or Visual Designer. A User Interface Designer usually identifies along with the Interaction Designer user needs and behaviors and builds what an interface might look like.

-  A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it's no good.

- The sixth role is a UI or Visual Design Content Strategist. So this is looking at the content and how the interface is actually being manifested through that. This could be both the needs of my users, the content for storytelling and the voice of the interaction and the system.

- The seventh role is a Frontend Developer. This is usually the roles are things like technology implication, visual coding and content logic. This is based on the reality that a wireframe or a drawing or a visual designer interface needs to be coded

- The eighth role is a UX or User Strategist. So User Experience strategy is kind of related to the larger context of technology implication, of how visual coding works and how the content logic works. So a relationship of looking at the entirety of the system from not only just the business but the users and where those things apply themselves.

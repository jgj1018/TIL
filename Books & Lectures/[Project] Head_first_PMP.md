A day in the life go a project manager

Gather product requirements

Manage stakeholder expectations.

Deal with project constraints.

PMO can be supportive, controlling, or directive

Six constraints ; time, cost, scope, resource, quality, risk

Any time your project changes, you’ll need to know how that change affects all of the constraints.

Whenever you are making a change that affects the project constraints, you need to be sure that the change is acceptable to your stakeholders.

Keep everyone satisfied by catching problems as early as possible.

Develop Project Charter process tells everyone in the company why the project is needed, and gives you the authority you need to make it happen. Then you use the Identify Stakeholders process to figure out who is affected by the project and how to communicate with them.

Use expert judgment and data gathering techniques to write your project charter

Project charter has,

Business Case (Why your company has decided to do this project)

Enterprise environmental factors tell you about how your company does business. (Market conditions, strategy, policies, cultures)

Organizational process assets tell you about how your company normally runs its projects. (lessons learned)

project charter is what authorizes the project manager to do the work, while the business case helps justify the project. You can think of the business case as the background research that had to be done in order to make sure the project was worth doing, and the project charter as the thing that formally announces the decision to do it.

The sponsor of a project is responsible for creating the project charter.

The sponsor of a project pays for the project. The PM manages the project.

You always have the authority to make changes to your project if they don’t affect cost, schedule, or scope.

An important reason that we do project integration is to make sure that the project stays aligned with the benefits it’s meant to bring.

Product scope means the features and functions of the product or service that you and your team are building.

Project scope is all of the work that needs to be done to make the product.

the project scope includes every single thing made by you and the team, and that includes the project plan and other project management documents.

As a project manager, your main concern is understanding that impact, and making sure everyone is OK with it before the change gets made. It’s not your job to decide which is the best feature for the product, just to help everybody involved keep their priorities in mind and do what’s best for the project.

The Collect Requirements process involves talking to the people who are affected by your project to find out what they need. All of the tools in this process are focused on getting your stakeholders to tell you about the problem that the project is going to solve. (…) One of the most important things to understand about requirements is that every requirement fulfills a specific stakeholder need.

* Joint application design is a facilitated workshop where users and the development team work together to define requirements. It’s sometimes called a JAD Session.

* User stories are short descriptions of functionality that end users need. Often teams collaborate to write user stories and use the actual story they write as a reminder of the discussion they had together. User stories are often written using this format:

As a <type of user>, I want to <specific action I’m taking> so that <the benefit from the action I’ve just taken>.

Use a questionnaire to get requirements from a bigger group of people

Sometimes observing the people who will use your product while they work with it will give you a better idea of how to solve their problems. People don’t always know what to say when you ask them for requirements, so watching them deal with the problem your product is going to address can help you to find requirements that they might not tell you about on their own.

You know your requirements are complete when you’ve got a way to verify each of them once they’re built.

The requirements document needs to list all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements of your product. Functional requirements are most of the kinds of things that you think of right away: new features, bug fixes, and new or different behavior. Nonfunctional requirements are sometimes called quality attributes because they’re things that you expect from your deliverables, but aren’t specific features. Some examples of nonfunctional requirements are performance, reliability, error handling, and ease of use.

Sometimes stakeholders know that they want things to get better, but they don’t know how to tell when they’ve succeeded. You need to work with them to find something that can be measured in their ideas about project success. Without a way to measure your success, you won’t know whether or not you are accomplishing your goals.

Any time you run into a change to your scope, regardless of where you are in the process, you put it through change control. Only after examining the impact and having the change approved can you incorporate the change.

- When you think about an MVP, This is the first thing you can give to the very first set of users you want to target in order to see if you can deliver any value at all to them.

- Some understanding of the problem is very helpful when building an MVP so please talk to your users before writing code.

- I have this saying hold the problem you're solving tightly, hold the customer tightly, hold the solution you're building loosely. 

- Iterate, continue improving on your solution until it actually solves a problem. 

- In most cases, most people should be building a very lean MVP
  - Very fast to build (weeks not months)
  - Very limited functionality (you need to condense down what your initial user needs)
  - Appeal to a small set of users.
  - Base to iterate from
  
  
- You should have a vision of everyone you should have an MVP very small.

- Heavy MVP (in very few cases)
  - significant regulation (insurance, banking)
  - Hardtech
  - Biotech
  - Moonshot
  
  
- Launch simply means to start getting customers.
- Learning from customers is easier with an MVP than without.
- Spending all that time on a pitch deck it's not as valuable as spending time building anything you can give to a customer.

- Hacks for building an MVP quickly.
  - Time box your spec
  - Write your spec
  - Cut your spec
  - Don't fall in love with your MVP! (It's just step one in a journey)
  
  
- Most of the goal here is just to get anything out in the world. Once you get anything out in the world to momentum to keep anything going is extremely strong.

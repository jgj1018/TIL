![How to Build a Product Roadmap by Walmart Senior Product Manager](https://youtu.be/x0d_GE_jWGE)

- There is never a shortage of ideas. The important job of a product manager is really not to come up with the ideas but it is to say "no" and it is really kind of to understand which ideas are most valuable to pursue.


- Product roadmap
  - it should reflect your product vision. It should tell the story about where your product is right now and where you want to get to, how you are getting there.
  - It should be a communication device.
  - It should be very simple.
  - It should be a source of truth for internal alignment.
  - Delivery date (or not)
  
  
- Input and Considerations when building a roadmap
  - Key problems
  - Solutions for those problsems.
  - Goals/OKRs of the product
  - Higher level mission of the company
  
- It is really important to understand what problem is solving for. It doesn't have to be a problem within the product. It is a problem the product is solving.


- How do I build one
  - Kick things off by having collaborative roadmapping sessions with your stakeholders.
    - Product manager have to set contexts to everybody. 
    - understand what the main goals and objectives are. get those stakeholders engaged early.
    - If you wanna to have a debate, this is the time to have it. you don't want to have it mid-development
    - start big, narrow down the ideas.

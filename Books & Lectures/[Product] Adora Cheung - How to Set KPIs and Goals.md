- KPI: a set of quantitative metrics that indicate how healthy your business is doing.

- Primary metric: You'd be willing to bet the whole company on.
  - represents delivery of real value? (Do they pay money for it?, daily active users)
  - captures recurring value?
  - lagging indicators?
  - usable feedback mechanism?
  
- MAU is not usually not a great metric because it takes time to understand the impact of movement. So many things can happen within a month.


- Revenue
  - 99% of you should actually use revenue as your primary metric
- Active users
  - a resonable proxy for revenue
  - Free users will give you different types of feedback than users who are actually paying you.
  - Building a large audience is actually a prerequisite to monetization
  - If you use it as a primary metric, It is important you define user appropriately. 
  
  
- To select a set of three to five other metrics secondary metrics to pair with your primary metric.

- The goal of your startup is to grow your primary metric.by doing this does two things.
   - Build something lots of people want 
   - reach and serve all those people

- Set weekly % growth goal.
  - A growth rate is five to seven percent a week, If you can hit ten 10% a week, you're doing exceptionally well.
  - small variations in week growth rates can make a huge difference on the monthly and yearly time horizon.
  - If you'd only manage 1% week growth, It's a sign you haven't figured out things yet. It's not a good sign you have a startup with a billion dollar potential.
  
  
- Some general guidelines when defining a goal.
  - Fast initial growth
  - Time to sale
  - Organic vs paid
  - Exponential vs linear
  
  
- metrics and goals obviously don't mean anything if you don't leverage them. use these as a motivational tool.
- It's okay if you don't hit your goal one or even two weeks in a row as long as you understand why. You should be always asking yourself what is the biggest obstacle in my way of hitting my weekly target, how do I overcome this and be obsessive this.

- Reality: The North Star is not the brightest star in the sky, but it has been used for navigation throughout history because of its “fixed” location in the sky3. In the context of the digital age, a team identifies that fixed point as the goal of their game plan and then sets course for it. This traditional business strategy approach can work to galvanize a team in a large slow-moving enterprise. But what if your solution is an innovative digital product or service about to be launched in a fast-moving consumer marketplace full of uncertainties? This requires an agile process that is variable and iterative with continuous feedback loops along the way. You don’t want a North Star to guide your UX strategy; instead, you want a goal or point toward which to steer every time you pivot.

- UX design and UX strategy are two different things. When you are doing design, you are creating something. When you are doing strategy, you are coming up with a game plan before creating something. One way to explain it is to just substitute the word “product” for “user experience.” A product strategist thinks about all the possibilities for the product and defines it after researching the potential customers and existing competitors. She thinks about how much the product will cost to make and be priced to sell at and how it will be distributed to different customer segments. In contrast, a product designer actually fabricates the thing. They are two separate disciplines.

- UX strategy typically goes beyond just one digital product. It can span dozens of different digital products, services, and platforms; it interconnects all members of a digital interface family and more often with an offline customer experience (CX). 

- Aspects of brand strategy can help define aspects of your product’s UX design and vice versa. But it’s easy to confuse these branding efforts and goals with a UX strategy. A poor UX can actually decrease the “brand value” of a product but not so much the other way around. Even the brandiest of brands can’t overcome the poor UX of a product

- Marketing can increase awareness for the product, but if the product sucks, that’s what the buzz will be

- Another important thing to remember is that a solid UX design no longer differentiates brands. For companies such as Google, users assume the UX will be good. Google doesn’t have to announce it anymore, and when it’s bad, it’s all the more jarring.

- UX strategy is the process that should be started first before the design or development of a digital product begins. It’s the vision of a solution that needs to be validated with real potential customers to prove that it’s desired in the marketplace. Although UX design encompasses numerous details such as design patterns, user flows, microcopy, and (ultimately) how easy it is for a user to accomplish a task, UX strategy is the “Big Picture.” It is the high-level plan to achieve one or more business goals under conditions of uncertainty.

- We are constantly playing our role as users, having positive or negative experiences, not only when using products, but also offline or brick and mortar services such as navigating in a supermarket, using ATM machines, searching for our gate at the airport, even using toilets can be challenging. And every experience online or offline can be designed or redesigned to be positive. It doesn't matter if it is an app, a website, or a Norman Door.

- A badly designed experience can not only be frustrating to the user, but can also highly impact a business, especially when we talk about online businesses. (...) a better design and checkout flow experience could have improved about 35% of ecommerce conversion.

- a good user experience can help companies not only increase revenue and save money, but also, a bad user experience can seriously impact satisfaction, costs, and sales.

- if you design a better user experience, you can boost your user retention.

- In the same study, researchers found that, among thousands of customers studied, the ones who had the best experiences in the past might spend about 140% more in comparison to those who had the poorest experience previously:

- some stakeholders may believe that they already know what their users want and need, besides having no clue of what UX is and how UX can help their business. 

- It is important to keep in mind that designing an effective user experience requires an understanding of the needs of both the business and users in order to designing a solution that meets them. By understanding the business goals and user needs, it will help you to find exactly what you should fix on the bad UX design

- Product managers drive the vision, strategy, design, and execution of their product.


### Vision

- A compelling vision articulates how the world will be a better place if you succeed.

- A vision is valuable only if it inspires the entire team

- Just as it takes 7 impressions to garner a response to a marketing message, you need to constantly repeat your vision.

- Litmus Test: Ask a team member where the product is ultimately going and see how often they recite back the vision.


### Strategy

- A compelling strategy details exactly how you'll dominate your market.

- A vision should be stable, but your strategy needs to be iterated on and refined until you find product/market fit.

- Ditch the business plan; instead focus on a few-page summary that captures each of your ciritical product/market fit hypotheses

  - Target Audience
    - This is not your pitch deck, so don't think about the broadest possible definition of your TAM
    - Instead think of the bullseye of your very best potential customers.
  - Product You're solving
    - Is the problem you're solving for your customer a vitamin (nice to have) or a painkiller (need to have)
  - Value propositions
    - Not the feature list, but instead the promise to your customer on the value you will deliver for them.
  - Strategic differentiation
    - why is your solution 10x better than the leading alternatives?
  - Competition
    - How will your solution win against direct competitors and indirect alternatives?
  - Acquisition strategy
    - How will you find & attract your potential customers?
    - And how will you do so cost-effectively?
  - Monetization strategy
    - What are your primary and secondary ways to make money?
    - Is there strong willingness to pay?
  - KPIs
    - What are the right metrics for you to know if you are headed in the right direction?
    
- Innovate on a few, use best practices for the rest    
- Minimze your dimentions of innovation 


### Design

- A compelling design delivers a useful, usable, and delightful experience to your customers.

- By bringing emotional intelligence to your product design.

- Start by falling in love with the problem you are solving for your target customers (but not...with the solution)

- Develop personas: Personas are fictional characters developed to represent the different archetypes of users of your product. A persona typically describes the goals, pain points, behaviors, and psychology associated with members of a particular segment. To bring them to life a name, a profile image, and sometimes even a background history are associated with them. A team usually develops one or more personas to represent the core audience of users they are optimizing their product for. 

- Increase exposure hours: It's the closest thing we've found to a silver bullet when it comes to reliably improving the designs teams produce. The solution? Expose hours. The number of hours each team member is exposed directly to real users iteracting with the team's designs or the team's competitor's designs. There is a direct correlation between this exposure and the improvements we see in the designs that team produces.

- Deliver delight by adding a desired emotion dimention to your product design process.

- Measure delight through Net Promoter Score (NPS)

### Execution

- relentless execution ultimately determines whether you'll make your vision a reality.

- Execution isn't just project management, but doing whatever it takes to win.

- You must also ensure you're pointiing the team in the right direction.

- Execution loop: Define, validate, iterate
  - Define your hypotheses
  - Validate each hypothesis
  - Iterate based on what you've learned
  
- #1 Goal: Increase execution loop velocity.
  - Fast iteration requires clear decision rights
  
- Establish yourself as the curator, not the creator of great ideas.

- Favor decisions today over decisions tomorrow (The enemy of decision-making is time)

- Reward engineering velocity over elegance 

- Invest in retrospectives: Improve your ability to accurately forecast (and ultimately improve) engineering cost & product outcome estimates through post-sprint retrospective

- Metrics: Learn to read the matrix
  - Build your intuition for metrics by spending time every day reviewing a few critical acquisition, engagement, and monetization dashboards.

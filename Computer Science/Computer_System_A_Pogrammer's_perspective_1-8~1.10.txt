1-8 Systems communicate with other systems using networks.

In practice, mordern systems are often linked to other systems by networks.

Example 

(1) User types "hello" at the ketboard
(2) Client sends "hello" string to telnet server
(3) Server sends "hello" string to the shell, which run the hello program and passes the output to the telnet server
(4) Telnet server sends "hello, world\n" string to client
(5) Client prints "hello, world\n" to string on display

1-9 Important Themes

1.9.1 Concurrency and Parallelism

Thread-level Concurrency

Until recently, most actual computing was done by a single processor, even if that processor had to switch among multiple tasks.
This configuration is known as a uniprocessor system.
Multi-core processors have several CPUs(referred to as cores) intergrated onto a single intergrated-circuit chip.
Hyperthreading, sometimes called simultaneous multi-threading, is a technique that allows a single CPU to execute multiple flows of control.

1.9.2 The Importance of Abstractions in Computer Systems.

1.10

The operating system kernel serves as an intermediary between the application and the hardware.
It provides three funcdamental abstractions.

(1) Files are abstractions for I/O devices.
(2) Virtual memory is an abstarction for both main memory and disks
(3) Processes are abstractions for the processor, main memory, and I/O devices.

Finally, networks provides ways for computer systems to communicate with one another. From the viewpoint of a particular
system, the network is just another I/O device.

The source program is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1

Most modern systems represent text characters using the ASCII standard that represents each character with a unique byte-sized integer value.

All information in a system-including disk files, programs stored in memory, and data transferred across a network-is represented as a bunch of bits.

In order to run hello.c on the system, the individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of low-level
machine-language instructions.

(Sequence) 

(1) hello.c (source program - text)

-> Pre-processor(cpp)

(2) hello.i (Modified source program - text)

-> Compiler(ccl)

(3) hello.s (Assembly program - text)

->Assembler(as)

(4) hello.o (Relocatable object programs - binary)
(+printf.o)

->Linker(ld)

(5) hello (Executable object programs - binary)
: printf function resides in a separate precompiled object file called printf.o which mush somehow be merged with hello.o.
The linker handles this merging, and the result is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.

#DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocal

TCP/IP protocols(our computers's built-in, internal  networking software) include a DHCP protocal. It automatically assigns and keeps tabs of IP addresses and any "subnetworks" that require them. Nearly all IP addresses are dynamic, as opposed to "static" IP addresses that never change. 

DHCP is a part of the "application layer" which is just one of the several TCP/IP protocols. A DHCP server is one computer on the network that has a number of IP addresses at its disposal to assign to the computers/hosts on that network. 

I'm the DHCP client. whenever I want to go on the Internet, my computer automatically requests and IP address from the network's DHCP server. If there's one available, the DHCP server sends a response containing an IP address to my computer.

#NAT - Network Address Traslation

This is the process where a network device, usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer (or group of computers) inside a private network. The main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use, for both economy and security purposes.

To access resources outside the network, like the Internet, computers have to have a public address in order for response to their requests to return to them. This is where NAT comes into play.

People tend to search for good agile metrics that provide this visibility. They expect to have a set of charts giving a deep understanding of the product status and the effort made and remaining. Reality, however, shows that such complexity is not necessary. Especially for the team, there are only few charts that team should use on daily basis. The Burndown chart is such a fundamental metric.

The Burndown chart is very simple. It is easy to explain, easy to understand. But there are pitfalls observed in many agile workshops and adoptions.

People tend to think the Burndown chart is so simple they do not give appropriate attention to understand what it says

# Sprint Burndown chart

Teams use the sprint Burndown chart to track the product development effort remaining in a sprint.

General speaking the Burndown chart should consist of:

X axis to display working days
Y axis to display remaining effort
Ideal effort as a guideline
Real progress of effort
Companies use different attributes on the Y axis. All of them have benefits and drawbacks.


# Remaining size

The chart displays the remaining size of all stories in a sprint backlog that needs to be done, using story points.

Stories are typically bigger items than tasks. Stories are also considered as done only when all tasks are completed. This leads to stairs in the Burndown chart.

Such stairs are usually not evaluated correctly. Especially management reads them as ‘no progress’ while they mean ‘effort continues, it has not been completed yet’. Steps could be smaller if stories are broken down in an appropriate way.

Simplicity of the chart does not help if process gaps need to be identified. In this case, two lines are not enough as they simply display a summary of work for all team members and the gaps need to be identified on a task board.

Usually it is unclear if a team is too late or somebody added additional work. Especially, in the case that an equal amount of work has been completed, there will be no progress indicated.

In this situation, viewing the total size of the sprint backlog should be helpful. Any change in the total size provides a clear explanation for the actual line issue.

It might be helpful to display impediment indicators as well. I think that impediments are a pain that should be visible. Having them on a Burndown chart is a good way to combine them with the progress giving the sprint overview.

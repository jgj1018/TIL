# PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITIES of Scrum master

- (1) Coach
: The ScrumMaster is the agile coach for the Scrum team—both the development team and the product owner. By coaching both roles, the ScrumMaster can remove barriers between the roles and enable the product owner to directly drive development.

`I’m not here to solve your problems for you; instead, I’m here to help you solve your own problems.`

- (2) Servant Leader

Even when acting as the team’s coach, the ScrumMaster is first and foremost a servant to the Scrum team, ensuring that its highest-priority needs are being met. A servant leader would never ask, “So, what are you going to do for me today?” Instead, a servant leader asks, “So, what can I do today to help you and the team be more effective?”

- (3) Process Authority

The ScrumMaster is the Scrum team’s process authority. In this capacity, the ScrumMaster is empowered to ensure that the Scrum team enacts and adheres to the Scrum values, principles, and practices along with the Scrum team’s specific approaches. The ScrumMaster continuously helps the Scrum team improve the process, whenever possible, to maximize delivered business value. The ScrumMaster also is not responsible for making sure the work gets done. Instead, the ScrumMaster helps the team define and adhere to its own process for making sure the work gets done.

- (4) Interference Shield

The ScrumMaster protects the development team from outside interference so that it can remain focused on delivering business value every sprint. 

- (5) Impediment Remover

The ScrumMaster also takes responsibility for removing impediments that inhibit the team’s productivity (when the team members themselves cannot reasonably remove them)

- (6) Change Agent

The ScrumMaster must help change more than faulty servers and similar impediments. A good ScrumMaster must help change minds as well. The ScrumMaster helps others understand the need for change, the impacts of Scrum outside of the Scrum team, and the broad-reaching benefits Scrum can help achieve. The ScrumMaster also ensures that effective change is occurring at all levels of the organization, enabling not only short-term success but, more importantly, the long-term benefits from using Scrum. In large organizations, the ScrumMasters might band together to become a more effective force for change.

# CHARACTERISTICS/SKILLS of Scrum master

- (1) Knowlegeable

To be an effective process coach, the ScrumMaster must be very knowledgeable about Scrum. The ScrumMaster should also understand the technical issues the team needs to address and technologies the team will use to create solutions. A ScrumMaster doesn’t need to have tech-lead- or dev-lead-level knowledge, but reasonable technical knowledge is an asset.

- (2) Questioning 

ScrumMasters use their coaching skills in conjunction with their process, technical, and business knowledge to ask great questions. They engage in intentional inquiry, asking the kinds of questions that make people stop and say, “Hmm. I never thought about that. Now that you ask that question, it makes me think there might be another way to go.” Great ScrumMasters almost never directly answer a question but instead reflexively answer with their own question—not an annoying question, or a question for the sake of asking a question, but rather a thoughtful, deep, probing question—thereby helping people realize that they have the insight to find their own answers (a form of Socratic questioning).

- (3) Patient

Because ScrumMasters prefer not to give out answers, they need to be patient, giving teams time to arrive at appropriate answers on their own. At times it is hard for me to be a ScrumMaster because I see the issue the team is dealing with and I “know” the answer.

- (4) Collaborative

The ScrumMaster must have excellent collaboration skills to work with the product owner, development team, and all the other parties, even those who might not be directly involved with Scrum.

- (5) Protective

The ScrumMaster should be very protective of the team. The common analogy is that the ScrumMaster acts like a sheepdog, guarding the flock from wolves that might try to attack. With acute sensitivity toward both team protection and business needs, the ScrumMaster helps the Scrum team achieve a healthy balance. 
The ScrumMaster also helps team members who begin to wander away from the flock. When things get difficult, it is easy for people to fall back on familiar, non-agile approaches. In this case it is the ScrumMaster’s job to help shepherd straying team members, helping them overcome their difficulties by reinforcing how to use Scrum more effectively.

- (6) Transparent

Finally, the ScrumMaster is transparent in all forms of communication. When working with team members, there is no room for hidden agendas; what you see and hear from the ScrumMaster must be what you get.

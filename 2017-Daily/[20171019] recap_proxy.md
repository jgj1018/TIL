# To recap Proxy

Proxy servers work as an intermediary between a client/server network connection.

- key features

(1) firewall and network data filtering support.
(2) network connection sharing.
(3) data caching.
 
: proxy servers work at the Application layer(layer 7) of the OSI model. a properly configured proxy server improves network security and performance for the target protocol(HTTP, SMTP etc)
Network administrators often deploy both firewall and proxy server software on network gateway server because they function at the OSI Application layer, the filtering capability of proxy servers is relatively more sophisticated compared to that of ordinary routers.

:On corporate networks, proxy servers are still commonly employed to distribute Internet connections across multiple routers and local intranet networks.

:caching may conserve bandwidth on the network, increasing its scalability. Next, caching can improve response time experienced by clients. Finally, proxy server caches increase content availability. Copies of web pages and other static content in the cache remain accessible even if the original source or an intermediate network link goes offline.
